This file contains all major changes made during the development of bftpd.
The uppermost change is the newest one.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.9.1
	- Avoid segfaults in options.c and main.c
	
Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.9
	- Added limits.h entry to main.c and options.c
	for compatibility with FreeBSD.
	(All problems with bftpd on FreeBSD were found and 
	corrected by Beech of the FreeBSD team.)

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.4
	- When printing file sizes for files larger than 4GB
	the file size is now displayed correctly.
	- When a FTP client drops a connection without sending
	an ABORT (ABOR) signal, Bftpd will detect the dropped
	connection and log it. This prevents stale connections
	preventing new users from connecting.
	(Bug found and fixed by: Thorsten)
	- Added limits.h and signal.h to list of headers used
	in commands.c, for compatibility with BSD.
	- Changed sighandler_t in "run_script()" to sig_t
	for compatibility between Linux and BSD.
	- Added OpenPAM patch from FreeBSD (login.c)
	- Added limits.h include to login.c file for
	compatibility with BSD.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.3
	- If Bftpd is unable to create bftpdutmp file, an error
	should now be written to the log file.
	- Directory output corrected for when large files (> 2GB)
	are listed.
	- Documentation for xinetd config updated.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.2
	- Changed bftpd's direcotry name to plain "bftpd"
	rather than "bftpd-version". This will, hopefully, make
	it easier to run scripts which build/run bftpd.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.1
	- Avoid segfault in getoption() (options.c)
	  Credit to Mats Erik Andersson for finding this bug.
	- Fixed potential memory leaks in commands.c

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.7.2
	- Fixed serious bug which would cause bftpd to crash
	while sending a file. Double-free error.
	(Credit to Davide Pozza for reporting these bugs below.)
	- Prevent buffer over-flow in parsecmd() when
	forming confstr variable.
	- Check return values of strtoul() to make sure they
	do not over-flow an int.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.7.1
	(Credit to Davide Pozza for reporting these bugs.)
	- Avoid memory over-flow in bftpd_login (login.c)
	with the str[] variable. Made size 512 + 1.
	- Avoid buffer over-flow in str[] variable in
	main().
	- Prevent buffer over-flow in check_file_password()
	when performing fscanf().
	- In check_file_password() made calloc() allocate
	larger buffer to prevent over-flow.
	- Performed range checking on the number of users on
	the system to make sure they don't over-flow a 32-bit int.
	- Make sure malloc calls in commands.c do not allocate
	too much or too little memory.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.6
	- Perform memory allocation check in bftpd_cwd_mappath()
	- Changed a strcmp() to strcasecmp() in command_retr function.
	- Performed free(mapped) at end of command_retr.
	- Performed memory checks and clean-up in various functions.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.5
	- The when using the FILE_AUTH option, the text
	password file can contain anonymous users. That is,
	users who do not require passwords. THIS IS DANGEROUS
	ON MOST SYSTEMS. A entry with the password field set to
	a * (star) does not require a password. See the
	config file option FILE_AUTH for more information.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.4
	- Allow ANONYMOUS_USER config file option to be used with
	the FILE_AUTH option. This basically allows anyone
	to login to the system without a password if both
	options are used!
	- When a chroot fails during login the server will
	no longer tell the client which directory it was trying
	to chroot to.
	- When the config.h file contains a definition for
	NO_GETPWNAM then the getpwnam() function is not used.
	Also, this forces the use of the FILE_AUTH option. If
	NO_GETPWNAM is defined and FILE_AUTH is not used, all
	connections are dropped.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.3
	- Introduced option to over-ride the local/LAN
	IP address assigned to the host computer. This
	option takes a 4-number IP address in the format
	of "127.0.3.101". See OVERRIDE_IP in bftpd.conf for
	more information.
	- Removed description-pak file from source tree.
	- The options PRE_WRITE_SCRIPT and POST_WRITE_SCRIPT
	have been added to the bftpd.conf file. These options
	let you run scripts before and after any command writes
	to the file system. Handy if you want to re-mount.
	Please see the bftpd.conf file for details.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.2
	- When using FILE_AUTH to login, check
	DO_CHROOT option before performing
	a chroot().

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.1
	- Removed code which uses sendfile().
	The sendfile code appears to cause a
	conflict on some systems when used
	with 64-bit file size variables.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6
	- Released bftpd without code changes, but
	with updated Polish documentation.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.5
	- Added Polish documentation to website.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.4.1
	- Added ability to use a plain text file
	  for authentication. See config file option
	  FILE_AUTH for details.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.4
	- Fixed default configuration.
	- Fixed compile warnings for vanilla config.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.3.2
	- Fixed Makefile to erase config.cache file during
	  "make clean"
	- Added ability to uncompress files on the fly
	  during downloads. Any file with the extension
	  ".gz" can be decompressed during transfer to
	  the client with the use of the GZ_DOWNLOAD
	  in the config file. This option requires bftpd
	  be configured (pre-compile time) with the flag
	  --enable-libz.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.3.1
	- Changed ratio values to unsigned long
	  variables to support large files.
	- Editted Makefile to allow bftpd to handle large
	  files (2GB+).

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.2.2
	- Added ability to upload files and
	  compress them into .gz files on the fly.
	  See bftpd.conf file for the option.
	  This option requires --enable-libz be
	  used when running the configure script.

	- Cleaned up code to avoid compiler warnings
	  from gcc 4.0.2.
	  Files changed: main.c commands.c

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.2.1
	- When the config file is re-read, global
          are changed only.   
          Files changes: options.c options.h


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.2
	- Made re-reable options be able to hold larger
	  values. Up to 256 bytes/characters long.
	- Replaced old rpm spec file with one from
	  Joe, which will be used from now on for
	  rpm builds.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.1.3
	- When a child/client dies, the
	  parent process will now attempt to
	  remove the client's log entry
	  from the bftpdutmp file. This
	  should prevent stale entries.
	- Changed some default values to
          constants in options.h
	- Fixed typo(s) in bftpd.conf
	- Set delete/over-write for global
	  users to be disabled by default
          in bftpd.conf.
        - Added the XFER_DELAY option to
          the bftpd.conf file. This allows
          the admin to set a time delay
          between data transfer bursts.
          This aid in bandwidth throttling.
          Please see bftpd.conf for more
          details on this feature.
	- Added more re-read options
          when catching signal SIGHUP.
          The re-readable options are now:
          HELLO_STRING, QUIT_MSG, XFERBUFSIZE,
          DATA_TIMEOUT, CONTROL_TIMEOUT,
          USERLIMIT_GLOBAL, USERLIMIT_SINGLEUSER,
          USERLIMIT_HOST, DENY_LOGIN and XFER_DELAY.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.1.2
	- Program now catches signal SIGHUP.
	- When bftpd catches the SIGHUP (hang up)
          it re-reads the config file. It looks
          for some config values, but not all.
          At this time, the values which are
          re-read are:
          HELLO_STRING, QUIT_MSG and XFERBUFSIZE

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.1.1
	- Added rpm spec file to redhat directory.
	- Changed numberic string length (512) to a defined
          string length (MAXCMD). Makes code more
          compatible with main.c and uses less stack
          memory. File changed: commands.c
	- When receiving files, the transfer buffer
          (XFER_BUFSIZE) is divided by the number of 
          connected clients. This should prevent bandwidth
          being sucked back by multiple connections.
	- Minor fixes, checking for malloc errors,
          freeing memory and closing sockets.
          File changed: commands.c
        - When sending files, the transfer buffer
          (XFER_BUFSIZE) is divided by the number
          of connected clients. This should prevent
          bandwidth being taken over by multiple connections.
	- Changed Makefile so bftpd.8 gets installed as
	  a manual page in the proper location.
          Also updated rpm spec file to include man page.


Jesse Smith <slicer69@hotmail.com> -> 1.1.0
	- Changed some bftpdutmp_log(0) lines to
	calls to bftpdutmp_end(). This should be safer.	
	- Made sure that clients cannot write or append
	to files if the "delete" command is disabled. I
	think if they cannot delete the file they shouldn't
	be allowed to truncate it to zero bytes either.
	- Added reason for login failure to log file.
	- Removed logging of getting user count from
	temp file. Just seems to be taking up space.

Jesse Smith <slicer69@hotmail.com> -> 1.0.24-2
	- Added ability to block multiple connections from the
	  same IP address. This will keep download managers and
	  Internet Explorer from taking up multiple connections.
          See the new option USERLIMIT_HOST in bftpd.conf.
	- Made sure that bftpd logs out stale control connections
	  via added calls to bftpdutmp_log(0).
	- Added alarm() calls before trying to read from
	  the control socket. We shouldn't assume we are going to
	  get anything.

Jesse Smith <slicer69@hotmail.com> -> 1.0.24-1
	- Fixed bug with NLIST command. The bftpd server should not be
	  sending leading path in front of filename when using NLIST.
	  File(s) affected: dirlist.c
	- Added the MGET command. Allows client to receive multiple files
	  with one command.
	  File(s) affected: commands.c
	- Added the MPUT command. Allows client to send multiple files
	  to the server with one command.
	  File(s) affected: commands.c

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.24
	- The PATH_BFTPDUTMP configuration option was added (idea by Szabo Peter
	  <pts@math.bme.hu>).
	- Whenever a data connection is established, the reply message now
	  contains the transfer mode (idea by Szabo Peter).
	- The -D, -h and -n command line options have been added (idea by Szabo
	  Peter). Some code was changed to support operation without a configuration
	  file.
	- ATTENTION! The option LOGFILE has changed. See sample config file.
	- In daemon mode, bftpd closes its sockets correctly now (important if you
	  have a lot of connections), problem discovered by Olivier Kaloudoff.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented Mozilla from getting directory lists (found
	  by Marc Pauls).
	- Daniel Mack fixed a memory leak in his code.
	- The configuration parser handles comments better now.
	- The USERLIMIT_GLOBAL configuration option has been added.
	- The USERLIMIT_SINGLEUSER configuration option has been added.
	- Some memory leaks discovered by David Heine <dlheine@suif.stanford.edu>
	  were fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.23
    - A serious file corruption bug using sendfile was fixed.
    - A makefile bug was fixed.
    - The AUTO_CHDIR and HIDE_GROUP configuration options were added.
    - A bug in the RNFR and RNTO functions has been fixed.
    - A bug occuring when compiling on StrongARM has been fixed.
    - The config file has been made more tolerant to missing spaces (error
      reported by Saus101 <Saus101@prime.gushi.org>).
    - A bug in the HELP function was fixed.
    - Two BSD incompatibilities have been fixed.
    - A STAT bug was fixed.
	- bftpd now follows symlinks.
	- A bug in the daemonmode code was fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.22
    - The ALLOW_FXP configuration option has been added.
    - The DATA_TIMEOUT configuration option has been added.
    - The PASSIVE_PORTS configuration option has been added.
    - A control timeout bug has been fixed.
    - Configuration options are now written like name="value", allowing
      comments after the option. Directories are written like
      directory "/foo/bar" {. Please update your config files!
    - bftpdutmp logging has been implemented as well as some administration
      functions using it. Read the updated documentation for details on how
      to use them.
    - You needn't link gzip statically to bftpd any more if you want on-the-fly
      compression, but you can dynamically link against zlib instead now.
      The pax sources are still needed for tar on-the-fly.
    - A directory listing bug reported by Hendrik Harms
      <hendrik.harms@bigfoot.de> has been fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.21
    - The XFER_BUFSIZE configuration option has been added, allowing tweaking
      of data throughput. If you and your clients are on a very fast network
      (fast meaning 100 Mbit/s or more), you should set this to 64000 or
      something like that.
    - The APPE command has been implemented.
    - The ALLO command has been implemented as an alias to NOOP.
    - The INITAL_CHROOT configuration option has been added. See the new
      example config file for details.
    - The ability to disable logging has been added :)
    - A bug making file transmissions impossible with old config files has
      been fixed.
    - A bug concerning file truncating when STORing has been fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.20
    - The FEAT function has been implemented.
    - A permission bug in the STOR function has been fixed.
    - The UMASK configuration option can now be used directory-specifically.
    - The EPSV and EPRT functions have been implemented, making IPv6 support
      possible somewhere in the future.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.19
    - The NLST function has been made usable again. There has been an
      unnoticed bug in it since the globbing function has been implemented.
    - The XCWD, XCUP, XMKD, XRMD and XPWD functions have been implemented
      as aliases to CWD, CDUP, MKD, RMD and PWD.
    - The documentation is now in the SGML format, making it more extensible,
      hopefully.
    - The DATAPORT20 configuration option has been added. If set to yes,
      the server will open data connections from port 20, which should make
      firewall users happier.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.18
    - The configuration file has been restructured. See README for details.
    - The PORT configuration option has been added, allowing you to change
      the port number the daemon should listen on (only for daemon mode).
    - A workaround for the /*/../* vulnerability mentioned on Bugtraq has
      been added, although it's not the right thing to do, really.
    - Compatibility to Solaris 8 has been improved. Josh Woodcock
      <josh@hamparts.com> and Michael Smirnov <smb@mh.vstu.edu.ru> gave
      some hints.
    - The CONTROL_TIMEOUT configuration option has been added. You can now
      say after how many seconds of idle time users should be kicked.
    - Hashes (#) in /etc/passwd and /etc/group are now supported as comments.
      This improves FreeBSD compatibility, I'm not sure about other systems.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.17
	- A globbing bug was fixed, making Midnight Commander able to connect
	  to bftpd.
    - A bug which appeared when doing LIST if a group line in /etc/group
      had more than 256 characters was fixed.
    - /etc/shells and /etc/ftpusers authentication were implemented by
      Christophe Bailleux.
    - You can now indent your configuration options with tabulators.
    - A small problem with the ip_conntrack_ftp kernel module has been fixed,
      which was the fault of ip_conntrack_ftp. It was found by Erik Hensema
      <erik@hensema.xs4all.nl>.
    - ASCII transfer mode has been implemented.
    - You can now prevent a user from executing specific commands by using
      the ALLOWCOMMAND_XXXX=no option.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.16
	- .tar and .gz on-the-fly support has been implemented. Look in the
	  README file if you want to do that.
	- Supplementary group IDs are now initialized correctly.
	- PORT commands now check if the supplied IP address really belongs
	  to the client, so that an attacker can't make the server connect
	  to a machine in its LAN.
	- A bug making the wtmp logging system unusable under BSD systems was
	  fixed.
	- A bug making the server crash when logging in a non-existent user
	  with ANONYMOUS_USER enabled was fixed.
	- A patch supplied by Christophe Bailleux was applied, changing the
	  following:
	    - Spaces after a command in each command string are removed.
	    - The HELP command was implemented.
	    - CWD to ~ now works.
	  
Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.15
	- You can override the default path to the config file with the command
	  line parameter '-c'.
	- wtmp logging was implemented, so that bftpd logins show up in
	  commands like 'last'.
	- You can have bftpd bind to only one interface, for example, if you
	  want to run an FTP proxy server on the same port on another network
	  interface.
	- The LIST and NLST commands now support globbing.
	- A security problem in the syslog code was fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.14
	- A lot of bugs found by Christophe Bailleux <cb@grolier.fr> have been
	  fixed, as always.
	- bftpd can now cope with special characters, such as umlauts.
	- SITE commands are now disabled by default.
	- A bug preventing resolution of GIDs on some systems has been fixed.
	- Debian packages are now built for every new version.
	- You can now specify if any password should fit for a particular user,
	  so that you don't have to set a user's password to nothing
	  (security).
	- You can now turn off chroot() for particular users.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.13
	- David L. Nicol <david@kasey.umkc.edu> tested bftpd on Tru64.
	  He also improved the character filtering routine.
	- Some RFC incompliance was fixed, improving compatibility with
	  FTPExplorer and LeechFTP.
	- The SIZE command was implemented.
	- A bug making the server segfault when being killed was fixed.
	- A buffer overflow bug found by asynchro <asynchro@pkcrew.org>,
      Jonathan Heusser <jonathanheusser@gyml.unibas.ch> and Christophe
	  Bailleux <cb@grolier.fr> was fixed.
	- The SITE CHMOD and SITE CHOWN commands were implemented. You can turn
	  them off in the config file.
	- A lot of useful changes proposed by Heiko Rother <rother@cmsnet.de>
          were made:
		- Standalone mode, independent from inetd
    	- Better support for symbolic links
		- Display of user/group name instead of UID/GID
		- Ability to set the umask
		- Ability to log into syslog

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.12
	- SmartFTP support was improved (parameters to LIST beginning with -
	  are discarded).
	- A buffer overflow bug found by Christophe Bailleux <cb@grolier.fr>
	  was fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.11
	- PAM support was implemented. Specify --enable-pam while starting
          configure to use it.
	- You can now specify users who should be unable to log in.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.10
	- Applied a big patch from Daniel Mack that makes some things better,
      for example virtual host support, a FreeBSD correction for the
      directory listings, etc.
    - The MDTM command was implemented.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.9
	- Fixed another bug preventing successful running on Solaris.
	- Implemented "message of the day".
	- Fixed an evil bug in string substitution.
	- Fixed a bug causing the server to crash when listing an empty
	  directory.

	- The PASV command was implemented.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.6
	- bftpd also compiles on FreeBSD and Solaris.
	- Aliases for users can be set.
	- Error messages are now printed correctly.
	- "In bftpd.conf you can define if you want bftpd to use /etc/shadow"
	  was removed again because it was stupid.
	- Ratio was added.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.5
	- ls-independant directory listing was implemented. You don't need
	  special directories or files in your home directory any longer.
	- Compiling works with configure for portability reasons now.
	- bftpd also compiles on BSD/OS and DG-UX.
	- The name of the log file can now be set in bftpd.conf.
	- The RMD command was implemented.
	- Internet Explorer and Netscape compatability was improved.
	- The REST command was implemented.
	- The ABOR command was implemented (but with very stupid code!).
	- In bftpd.conf you can define if you want bftpd to use /etc/shadow.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.4
	- Logging was implemented.
	- A wrong error number for 'Permission denied' was fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.3
	- A config file and two options have been implemented: You can
	  disable the server and you can disable .ftp.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.2
	- It is now checked if .ftp is a symbolic link so that users don't
	  link .ftp to /.
