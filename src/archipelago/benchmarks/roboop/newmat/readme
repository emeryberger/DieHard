ReadMe file for newmat09, an matrix library in C++.
---------------------------------------------------

Documentation is in newmat.txt. An html version of the documentation
can be downloaded from http://webnz.com/robert/ or
http://webnz.co.nz/robert/.

Read the section on "customising" in newmat.txt before attempting to
compile this program. You will very likely need to edit the options in
include.h.

I now use bool, true and false in place of Boolean, TRUE and FALSE in
line with the new C++ standard. If your compiler (Borland 5.0, MS Visual
C++ 5 or Gnu 2.7.2) supports this construct you will need to edit
include.h to disable my bool class.

I have changed ReDimension to ReSize.

Look at the section on "updating from previous versions" in newmat.txt
for other changes. 

Please look on http://webnz.com/robert/ or http://webnz.co.nz/robert/
for any latest bug lists and current version information.
