<H1>Background Details</H1>

<H2><A NAME="DNS">Domain Names</A></H2>

<BR><P>

Domain names are used to uniquely name each host on the Internet.  A
domain name has a number of parts separated by periods.  Each label
represents a level in the hierarchy.  An example of a name is: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
olive.cac.washington.edu 
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In this domain name the top-level label is <EM>edu</EM>, indicating it is
at an educational institution, the second-level label is
<EM>washington</EM>, indicating the University of Washington. 
<EM>cac</EM> is a specific department within the University of Washington,
and <EM>olive</EM> is the host name.  The top-level names are assigned by
Internet organizations, and other names are assigned at the appropriate
level.  The Domain Name Service, DNS, is the distributed database used to
look up these names.  <P>

<EM>Pine</EM> relies on domain names in multiple places.
A domain name is embedded
into the message-id line generated for each piece of email.  A domain name
is needed to contact an IMAP server to get access to remote INBOXes and
folders.  Most importantly, domain names are needed to construct the From:
line of your outgoing messages so that people on the Internet will be able
to get email back to you.  <P>

On UNIX systems, you can set the domain via the <A 
HREF="config.html#user-domain"><EM>user-domain</EM></A>
variable in the <EM>Pine</EM> configuration file, or rely on the file
<CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE> which usually sets the name of the local host. 
While <EM>Pine</EM> can often deliver email without the domain name
being properly
configured, it is best to have this set correctly.  Problems can usually be
solved by adjusting the system's entry in the <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE>
file.  The fully-qualified name should be listed before any abbreviations. 

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
128.95.112.99   olive.cac.washington.edu   olive
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is preferred over

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
128.95.112.99   olive   olive.cac.washington.edu
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

On PCs, the task of configuring the domain name is a bit different.  Often
times, PCs do not have domain names-they have <EM>IP addresses</EM>.  IP
addresses are the numbers which uniquely identify a computer on the
network.  The way you configure your IP address depends on the networking
software which you use on the PC.  You can refer to the documentation
which came with your networking software or see the <A
HREF="installation.html#install-pc">PC specific installation notes</A> for
help configuring the IP address with your network software.  <P>

With PCs, it is vital that users set the variable <A
HREF="config.html#user-domain"><EM>user-domain</EM></A> in the <EM>Pine</EM>
configuration file (<CODE>PINERC</CODE>).  <P>

Details on configuring <EM>Pine</EM> with correct domain names can be
found in the <A HREF="config-notes.html#domain">Domain Settings</A>
section of this document.  <P>

<H2><A NAME="rfc822">RFC 822 Compliance</A></H2>

<EM>Pine</EM> tries to adhere
to <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc822.txt">RFC
822</A> a little more strongly than some other mailers and uses the
<EM>"full name &lt;address&gt;"</EM> format rather than the older
<EM>"address (full name)"</EM> format.  The intent of the standard is that
parentheses should only be for comments.
<EM>Pine</EM> displays and generates the
newer format, but will parse the old format and attempt to turn it into
the new one.  <P>

As far as outgoing email is concerned, <EM>Pine</EM> fully-qualifies addresses
whenever possible.  They are even displayed in fully-qualified form on the
terminal as the user composes a message.  This makes addresses more clear
and gives a hint to the user that the network extends beyond the local
organization.
<EM>Pine</EM> implements fully-qualified domain names by tacking on
the local domain to all unqualified addresses which a user types in.  Any
address which does not contain an "@" is considered unqualified.  <P>

The newer format for addresses allows for spaces and special characters in
the full name of an address.  For this reason, commas are required to
separate addresses.  If any special characters as defined in RFC 822
appear in the full name, quotes are required around the address.  <EM>Pine</EM>
will insert the quotes automatically.  The common cases where this happens
are with periods after initials and parentheses.  <P>

Because <EM>Pine</EM> fully complies with RFC 822,
it is sometimes difficult to use
non-Internet address formats such as UUCP's <CODE>host!user</CODE> or
DECNet's <CODE>USER::HOST</CODE> with <EM>Pine</EM>.
People who run <EM>Pine</EM> on these
systems have made local modifications to <EM>Pine</EM> or to the mail transport
agent (e.g. <CODE>sendmail</CODE>) to make things work for them.  <P>

<EM>Pine</EM> expects dates to be in the standard RFC 822 format
which is something like: 

<PRE>
	[www, ] dd mmm yy hh:mm[:ss] [timezone] 
</PRE>

It will attempt to parse dates that are not in this format.  When an
unparsable date is encountered it is displayed as <EM>xxx xx</EM> when
shown in the FOLDER INDEX screen.  <P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="SMTP">SMTP and Sendmail</A></H2>

<EM>Pine</EM> is a <EM>user agent</EM> not a <EM>message transfer agent.</EM> In
plain English, that means <EM>Pine</EM> does not know how to interact with other
computers on the Internet to deliver or receive email.  What <EM>Pine</EM> does
know how to do is help users read, organize and create email.  The "dirty
work" of delivering and accepting email is handled by other programs.  <P>

All outgoing email is delivered to a mail transfer program or to an SMTP
server.  The most common mail transfer program is <CODE>sendmail</CODE>.

<DL>

<DT> Pine 3.91 and earlier:

<DD>
When <EM>Pine</EM> on a UNIX computer uses the local <CODE>sendmail</CODE>, it
first writes the message to a temporary file in <CODE>/tmp</CODE>. Then
<EM>Pine</EM> runs a shell in the background that runs
<CODE>sendmail</CODE> on the
temporary file and then removes it.  This is done with a shell in the
background so the user doesn't have to wait for <CODE>sendmail</CODE> to
finish.  By default, <CODE>sendmail</CODE> is invoked with the
<CODE>-t</CODE> flag to cause it to read and parse the header to determine
the recipients; the <CODE>-oem</CODE> flag to cause errors to be mailed
back; and the <CODE>-oi</CODE> flag to ignore dots in incoming messages. 
Systems administrators can choose to configure <EM>Pine</EM> to use a different
mail transfer program or even <CODE>sendmail</CODE> with different flags. 
See the section on
<A HREF="installation.html#pine-compile">UNIX Pine Compile-time Options</A>
for more details on this.  <P>

<EM>Pine</EM> can also operate as an SMTP client.  SMTP stands for <EM>Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol</EM>; it specifies the rules by which computers on the
Internet pass email to one another.  In this case, <EM>Pine</EM> passes outgoing
email messages to a designated SMTP server instead of to a mail transfer
program on the local machine.  A program on the server then takes care of
delivering the message.  To make <EM>Pine</EM> operate as an SMTP client, the
<A HREF="config.html#smtp-server"><EM>smtp-server</EM></A> variable
must be set to the IP address or 
host name of the SMTP server within your organization.  This variable accepts a
comma separated list of servers, so you can specify multiple SMTP servers. 
<EM>PC-Pine</EM> only runs as an SMTP client.  <P>


<DT> Pine 3.92 and later:

<DD> The selection of which MTA to use depends on the settings of
<A HREF="config.html#sendmail-path"><EM>sendmail-path</EM></A>,
<A HREF="config.html#smtp-server"><EM>smtp-server</EM></A>, and compile-time
options.  The first MTA specified in the following list is used:

<OL>

<LI><EM>sendmail-path</EM> in
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed</CODE>

<LI><EM>smtp-server</EM> in <CODE>/usr/local/pine.conf.fixed</CODE>

<LI><EM>sendmail-path</EM> specified on the command line. 

<LI><EM>smtp-server</EM> specified on the command line. 

<LI><EM>sendmail-path</EM> in the user's <CODE>.pinerc</CODE> file. 

<LI><EM>smtp-server</EM> in the user's <CODE>.pinerc</CODE> file. 

<LI><EM>sendmail-path</EM> in <CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf</CODE>

<LI><EM>smtp-server</EM> in <CODE>/usr/local/pine.conf</CODE>

<LI><CODE>DF_SENDMAIL_PATH</CODE> defined at compile time.

<LI><CODE>SENDMAIL</CODE> and <CODE>SENDMAILFLAGS</CODE> defined at
compile time. 

</OL><P>

If the <EM>sendmail-path</EM> form is used, a child process is forked,
and the specified command is executed with the message passed on standard
input.  Standard output is then passed back and displayed for the user. 
<EM>NOTE: The program MUST read the message to be posted on standard
input, AND operate in the style of sendmail's "-t" option.  </EM><P>

If an <EM>smtp-server</EM> is specified, a connection to the server is
opened.  If the message contains 8-bit text, ESMTP 8BITMIME negotiation is
attempted.  The message is then sent using SMTP commands. <P>

If none of the above are set, the default <CODE>sendmail</CODE> program is
invoked with the "<CODE>-bs -odb -oem</CODE>" flags, ESMTP negotiation is
attempted, and the message is sent. 

</DL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="IMAP">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</A></H2>

IMAP is a remote access protocol for message stores. <EM>Pine</EM> uses IMAP to get
at messages and folders which reside on remote machines. With IMAP, all
messages are kept on the server.  An IMAP client (such as <EM>Pine</EM>) can
request specific messages, headers, message structures, etc.  The client
can also issue commands which delete messages from folders on the server.
IMAP's closest kin is POP, the Post Office Protocol, which works by
transferring an entire mailbox to the client where all the mail is kept.
For a comparison of IMAP and POP, see the paper "<A
HREF="http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.brief.html">Comparing Two Approaches
to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP</A>" by Terry Gray.  A more
detailed exploration of message access may be found in the paper "<A
HREF="http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html"> Message Access Paradigms and
Protocols</A>."  These papers may be found in the <CODE>/mail</CODE>
directory of the anonymous FTP server at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu"><CODE>ftp.cac.washington.edu</CODE></A>. 
<P>

IMAP Features:  

<UL> 

<LI> Allows access to mail folders from more than one client computer. 
 
<LI> Works well over low-bandwidth lines because information is sent in
small pieces as needed by the user.  For example, only header information
is sent to build index lists, and if someone sends a 2MB audio file via
MIME, you can choose when (or if) you want to get that part of the
message. 
 
<LI> Email can be delivered and stored on a well-maintained and reliable
server which is "always-up".
 
<LI> Folders can be accessed and manipulated from anywhere on the
Internet.
 
<LI> Users can get to messages stored in different folders within the same
<EM>Pine</EM> session. 
 
<LI> Allows use of IMAP server for searching and parsing.  

<LI> The latest revision of IMAP (IMAP4) also provides for disconnected
operation, including resynchronization of message state between mail
servers and message caches on clients.  <EM>Pine</EM> does not yet support this
capability, however.

</UL>

IMAP2 is defined in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1176.txt">RFC
1176</A>.  IMAP4rev1, the revision to IMAP2, is described in <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3501.txt">RFC 3501</A>.  Further
information about IMAP may be obtained from the University of Washington's
<A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/imap/">IMAP Information Center</A> on
the World Wide Web.<P>

<EM>Pine</EM> 4.00 is an IMAP4rev1 client.

<H2><A NAME="MIME">Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)</A></H2>

MIME is a way of encoding a multipart message structure into a standard
Internet email message.  The parts may be nested and may be of seven
different types:  Text, Audio, Image, Video, Message, Application and
Multipart (nested).  The MIME specification allows email programs such as
<EM>Pine</EM> to reliably and simply exchange binary data (images, spreadsheets,
etc.). MIME includes support for international character sets, tagging each
part of a message with the character set it is written in, and providing
7-bit encoding of 8-bit character sets. It also provides a simple rich
text format for marking text as bold, underlined, and so on. There is a
mechanism for splitting messages into multiple parts and reassembling them
at the receiving end.  <P>

The MIME standard was officially published in June of 1992 as <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1341.txt">RFC 1341</A> and subsequently
revised in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2045.txt">RFC 2045</A>
when it became a full Internet Standard.  <EM>Pine</EM> 3.0 was one of the first
email programs to Implement MIME.  Now, there are dozens of commercial and
freely available MIME-capable email programs. In addition, MIME is being
added to newsreaders so MIME messages can be posted and read in USENET
newsgroups.  <P>

The MIME standard also includes support for non-ASCII text in message
headers through the extensions described in <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1342.txt">RFC 1342</A> and subsequently
revised in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2047.txt">RFC 2047</A>. 
Support for RFC 2047 was added in <EM>Pine</EM> 3.92.<P>

An actual MIME message looks something like this: 
 
<PRE>
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 1996 15:39:35 -0800 (PST)
From: David L Miller &lt;dlm@cac.washington.edu&gt;
To: David L Miller &lt;dlm@cac.washington.edu&gt;
Subject: =?iso-8859-1?Q?Test_MIME_message_with_RFC-1522_headers_=28=E1?=    =?iso-8859-1?Q?=E2=E3=29?=
Message-Id: &lt;Pine.ULT.3.92.960312150851.21583I-101000@shiva2.cac.washington.edu&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: MULTIPART/MIXED; BOUNDARY="0-1737669234-826673975=:21583"
Content-Id: &lt;Pine.ULT.3.92.960312153928.21583O@shiva2.cac.washington.edu&gt;

  This message is in MIME format.  The first part should be readable text,
  while the remaining parts are likely unreadable without MIME-aware tools.
  Send mail to mime@docserver.cac.washington.edu for more info.

--0-1737669234-826673975=:21583
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-ID: &lt;Pine.ULT.3.92.960312153104.21583L@shiva2.cac.washington.edu&gt;

The text of the message would go here. It is readable if
one doesn't mind wading around a little bit of the MIME
formatting. After this is a binary file in base 64
encoding.

For details about <EM>Pine</EM>'s implementation of MIME, see the two MIME sections

<H2><A NAME="collections">Folder Collections</A></H2>

Folder Collections are <EM>Pine</EM>'s way of dealing with more than a single group
of folders.  With advent of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> and the development of tools within
IMAP to better manage remote folders, the time was ripe to provide a
mechanism for defining a group of remote folders.  <EM>PC-Pine</EM> forced the
issue in that many potential <EM>PC-Pine</EM> users would be migrating from UNIX
<EM>Pine</EM> in a time-sharing environment and, thus, would have some investment
in their archived messages on that host.  <P>

For a more complete description of Folder Collections, see the section on
"<A HREF="config-notes.html#collections">Syntax for Collections</A>."  <P>

The <EM>Pine</EM> distribution is designed to require as little configuration and
effort at compile time as possible.  Still, there are some <EM>Pine</EM> behaviors
which are set at the time you compile <EM>Pine</EM>.  For each of these, there is a
reasonable (our opinion) default built into the code, so most systems
administrators will have no need for these steps.  <P>
