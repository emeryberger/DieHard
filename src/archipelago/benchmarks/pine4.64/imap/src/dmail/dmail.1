.TH DMAIL 1 "May 18, 2004"
.SH NAME
dmail \- procmail Mail Delivery Module
.nh
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dmail
.I [\-D] [\-f from_name] [-s] [user][+folder]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dmail
delivers mail to a user's INBOX or a designated folder.
.I dmail
may be configured as a drop-in replacement for
.IR binmail (1),
.IR mail.local (1)
for use with a mail delivery filter such as
.IR procmail (1) .
.PP
Because of security considerations (see below)
.I dmail
is not intended to be used for direct delivery by the mailer daemon;
.IR tmail (1)
is the preferred tool for this purpose.  If
.I dmail
is used for mailer daemon delivery, the mailer daemon must invoke
.I dmail
with the
.I dmail
process' user id set to the recipient's user id.
.PP
When
.I dmail
exits, it returns exit status values to enable
.IR procmail (1)
to determine whether a message was delivered successfully or had a
temporary (requeue for later delivery) or permanent (return to sender)
failure.
.PP
If the
.I user
name is present, it must be the same as the logged-in user name.
.PP
If the 
.I +folder
extension is included in the user argument (or appears by itself if there
is no user argument), 
.I dmail
will attempt to deliver to the designated folder.  If the folder does not 
exist or the extension is not included, the message is delivered to the 
user's INBOX.
If delivery is to INBOX and no INBOX currently exists,
.I dmail
will create a new INBOX.
.I dmail
recognizes the format of an existing INBOX or folder, and appends the new
message in that format.
.PP
The \fB-D\fR flag specifies debugging; this enables additional message
telemetry.
.PP
The \fB-f\fR or \fB-r\fR flag is used to specify a Return-Path.  The header
.br
   Return-Path: <\fIfrom_name\fR> 
.br 
is prepended to the message before delivery.
.PP
The
.B -s
flag specifies that the message will be flagged as being "seen".
.SH RESTRICTIONS
Absolute pathnames and 
.I ~user
specifications are not permitted in
.I +folder
extensions.
.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Unlike
.I tmail
you can use
.I dmail
to deliver to IMAP4 namespace names via
.I +folder
extensions.  This means that it is possible to deliver to
.IR mh (1)
format mailboxes.
.PP
However, this can also include such namespaces as #shared, #public,
and #ftp.  In most cases, it is undesirable to allow anybody sending
mail to the user to deliver to these namespaces.  Consequently, there
needs to be a rule in place in the configuration of either
.IR sendmail (8)
or
.IR procmail (1)
to prevent such abuse.
