         Help text for the Pine mailer

This file is in a format created to be turned into text strings in a C
program.

NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE

     If you are familiar with versions of this file PRIOR to 
     Pine 4.00 forget what you know.  No more '{' sensitivity.
     No more escaping double-quote character.

NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE-NOTE

There are two shell scripts that run on this.  Cmplhelp.sh is the
first and turns this into a C file (helptext.c) of text strings that
are compiled and linked. The other program, cmplhlp2.sh, turns this
into a .h file (helptext.h) with extern string definitions of the
strings in the .c file.  The code that actually processes these files
while pine is running is in help.c

The lines with "===== xxxx ====" divide the different help screens.  The
xxx is the name of the variable that strings will be put in, which are
also declared in helptext.h.

# is a comment

Help text screen text can be either plain text OR HTML.  The latter is
denoted by the first line starting with "<HTML>".  The former is simply
displayed as it's formatted here.

HTML is limited to simple formatting ala HTML 2.0.  No forms, or tables.
In addition a small set of tools are are available to customize the HTML
screen's text:

1a)  Default and function key bindings are separated like this:

<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
	Function key bindings here
<!--chtml else-->
	Default key bindings here
<!--chtml endif-->


1b)  A way to distinguish HTML text that is to be displayed when
     pine is running vs. when the text is served up outside Pine
     (someday) can be done via:

<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
   Text displayed when viewed within a running pine session
<!--chtml else-->
   Text displayed when HTML viewed outside pine (using chtml aware server)
<!--chtml endif-->

1c)  A way to distinguish HTML text that is to be displayed under
     PC-Pine vs. not is available via:

<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
   Text displayed under PC-Pine
<!--chtml else-->
   Text displayed otherwise
<!--chtml endif-->

WARNING ABOUT CHTML "if-else-endif" CLAUSES: They don't nest.

2a) Several "server side include" commented elements are supported:

<!--#include file="textfile"--> 

The file "textfile" will be inserted into the HTML text directly.
Pine does no formatting of the text.  At some point we might want to
look at the first line for <HTML> but not today.

2b) Various bits of Pine's running state can be inserted into the
HTML text as well using the special comment:

<!--#echo var="variable"--> 

Where "variable" is one of either:

    PINE_VERSION
    PINE_COMPILE_DATE
    PINE_TODAYS_DATE
    _LOCAL_FULLNAME_
    _LOCAL_ADDRESS_
    _BUGS_FULLNAME_
    _BUGS_ADDRESS_
    CURRENT_DIR
    HOME_DIR
    PINE_CONF_PATH
    PINE_CONF_FIXED_PATH
    PINE_INFO_PATH
    MAIL_SPOOL_PATH
    MAIL_SPOOL_LOCK_PATH

3) The URL scheme "X-Pine-Gripe:" is available to insert links to
   pine's composer such that various debugging data can be attached to the
   message. Aside from normal email addresses, this can be set to
   either "_LOCAL_ADDRESS_" for the configured local help address, or
   "_BUGS_ADDRESS_" for the configured local bug reporting address.
   Aside from the special tokens above, the default behavior only differs
   from "mailto:" by the insertion of a special Subject: prefix that
   consists of a randomly-generated token for tracking purposes.
   Several optional parameters can be included to control what is
   attached or offered for attachment to the message:

        ?config  --  Automatically attaches the user's configuration
                     information to the trouble report
        ?keys    --  Automatically attaches the user's most recent
                     keystrokes
        ?curmsg  --  Causes the user to get an offer to attach the
                     current message to the trouble report
        ?local   --  Automatically attaches the result of the script 
                     defined by VAR_BUGS_EXTRAS

For HTML-format sections, the help screen dividers  "===== xxxx ====" must 
contain one and only one space after the first and before the second set of 
equal signs.

Note to authors of this file: to mark sections that need further revision, 
please use the text string on the following line consistently so that it is 
easy to find those places again in this file:
*revision needed*

NOTE: Several sections of help text which weren't being used were removed
at RCS version number 4.122.  In particular, there were some placeholders
with help text for the config screen and the composer that didn't have any
reasonable place to be called from.

<P>
Pine&reg; is the University of Washington's &quot;Program for Internet
News and Email&quot;. It is intended to be an easy-to-use program for
sending, receiving, and filing Internet electronic mail messages and
bulletin board (Netnews) messages.  There are versions that will run on
many different flavors of the Unix&reg; operating system, as well as a
version with GUI amenities for 32-bit flavors of Microsoft Windows (95,
98, NT, 2000, Me, and XP).


<H2>New in Pine <!--#echo var="PINE_VERSION"--></H2>

Version <!--#echo var="PINE_VERSION"--> 
addresses bugs found in previous releases and has a few additions as well.

<P>
Additions include:
<P>

<UL>
   <LI> Even though Pine does not properly support the UTF-8 character set, the <A HREF="h_config_ldap_opts_ldap_v3_ok">Allow-Version3-LDAP</A> feature will cause Pine to go ahead and try to talk to an LDAP server which is a version 3 server. You will find this feature in the Setup/Directory screen. It is separately settable for each server you configure.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs that have been addressed in this release include:
<P>

<UL>
   <LI> Crash with malformed mailbox name that allows an authorized user to run commands from the shell
   <LI> When a PC-Pine network read, or a non-SSL Unix Pine network read took longer than <A HREF="h_config_tcp_readwarn_timeo">Tcp-Read-Warning-Timeout</A> (default 15 seconds) Pine would always time out instead of allowing the user to continue
   <LI> Bug when setting <A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string">Reply-Indent-String</A> to the Empty Value. Quote showed up as a double quote instead of as nothing.
   <LI> Crash when Pine attempts to open a remote (IMAP, POP3, NNTP) mailbox specification that has an unterminated quoted string in the network part of the name
   <LI> Sorting by Score would not work after changing a message's score by setting a keyword or changing its status
   <LI> Crash when adding then deleting the first header color
   <LI> Crash when Bouncing a message and then selecting the address to bounce the message to using ^T and the directory server screen
   <LI> When exporting a flowed message, perform wrapping to get rid of long lines and space stuffing
   <LI> Incorrect MESSAGE INDEX when message contains some high-bit characters (do a better job of ensuring that control characters in a message don't reach the screen by mistake)
   <LI> Limit amount of delay that can be caused by the system clock jumping backwards
   <LI> Bug that caused confirmation prompt to be skipped when Apply Saving messages with the first message in the set not having deleted parts
   <LI> Allow commas in <A HREF="h_config_custom_hdrs">Customized-Hdrs</A> fields and in header fields defined in Roles
   <LI> When two Pines were accessing the same address book and the two Pines had different ideas of how it should be sorted, they could get into a slow loop changing the sort order back and forth forever. Now give up and leave the sort alone after the first time this happens in a session.
   <LI> When <A HREF="h_config_blank_keymenu">Disable-Keymenu</A> was set the &quot;Other&quot; subcommand did not work correctly in the Apply command
   <LI> When an address book contained multiple entries with the same nickname the ^T method of selecting always selected the first
   <LI> Crash when editing the first of two address book entries with the same nickname and changing the first from a single address into a list of addresses
</UL>

<P>
Version 4.63
addressed bugs found in previous releases and had a few additions as well.

<P>
Additions included:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> When cancelling a message being composed the commands are now &quot;^C&quot; followed by &quot;<EM>C</EM>onfirm&quot; instead of &quot;^C&quot; followed by &quot;<EM>Y</EM>es&quot;. &quot;^C&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; was close to &quot;^X&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;, the command used to send a message. The change is there to prevent inadvertent cancellations. The old behavior may be restored by setting the feature <A HREF="h_config_cancel_confirm">Compose-Cancel-Confirm-Uses-Yes</A>.
  <LI> Command-line option "-url" can now be used with "-attach" and similar options
  <LI> <A HREF="h_config_quell_user_id_prompt">Quell-User-Id-Prompt</A> no longer falls back on prompting for user-id if a connection to the INBOX can't be established
  <LI> New token _CURNEWS_ which is equal to the current newsgroup if there is one, mostly for use with the <A HREF="h_config_reply_intro">Reply-Leadin</A> option
  <LI> New token <A HREF="h_config_arrow_color">ARROW</A> for use in the <A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A> option for the MESSAGE INDEX screen. This causes the current message to be indicated by an arrow instead of being shown in reverse video. It may also be colored if desired.
  <LI> New feature <A HREF="h_config_force_arrow">Force-Arrow-Cursor</A> turns on an &quot;arrow&quot; cursor in the MESSAGE INDEX just like you get with the <A HREF="h_config_force_low_speed">Assume-Slow-Link</A> feature turned on, except the coloring of the index line will still take place.
  <LI> Address book entries can be <A HREF="h_ab_export_vcard">exported</A> to a file in tab-separated columns for more convenient import to some other clients
  <LI> New variable <A HREF="h_config_quote_replace_string">Quote-Replace-String</A> and feature <A HREF="h_config_quote_replace_noflow">Quote-Replace-Nonflowed</A> allow for replacing quotes with the string of the user's choice when viewing a message
  <LI> <A HREF="h_config_role_charsetpat">Character Set</A> matching can now be done conveniently in Rules
  <LI> Field for <A HREF="h_config_role_comment">comments</A> added to Rules. Warning: Don't use this field until all of the Pines that you run are version 4.63 or higher, since it will cause the Rule to be ignored in previous versions.
  <LI> There is a new filterNow command located under Setup/Rules which causes your filters to be re-run immediately. This is <EM>not</EM> useful for most users since filters are run immediately as new mail arrives, but it may be useful if you want to re-run filters after changing the status (New, Important, Deleted, and so on) of messages and you don't want to wait until exiting the folder or expunging.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs addressed in the 4.63 release included:
<P>

<UL>
   <LI> Crash when an IMAP server dies while browsing the server's collection of folders
   <LI> Crash with message &quot;Lock when already locked&quot; when saving multiple messages where some of those messages have had attachments deleted
   <LI> Possible crash when viewing an attachment with an encoded name
   <LI> Crash when saving from a local folder which has been closed due to external modification
   <LI> TABbing for new mail in a news maildrop with multiple newsrcs was broken
   <LI> Role <A HREF="h_config_role_inick">inheritance</A> only worked one level deep
   <LI> When viewing messages with the <A HREF="h_config_quote_suppression">Quote-Suppression-Threshold</A> turned on, non-flowed messages with long lines that wrapped caused confusion with the quoted line counting
   <LI> Malformed addresses were not always handled cleanly when replying. Now the original address should be presented to the user who must sort it out.
   <LI> In PC-Pine, Postponed tab was needlessly grayed out when editing headers.
   <LI> It wasn't possible to add a collection that was a sub-collection of the open Inbox on a cyrus server because Pine tried to create the directory Inbox and that Folder/Directory already existed
   <LI> Handles (for example, for URLs) would sometimes be selectable even though they had been scrolled off the screen one line, causing confusion
   <LI> Failed to notice expunges in local folders which were in mbx format
   <LI> In composer: ^R to reveal Attachment line, attach a file without leaving the line (e.g. with ^T), then ^R while still in the Attachment line, and the attachment was not sent
   <LI> When viewing format=flowed messages with the DelSp=yes parameter urls were not recognized if they were split in the middle. It is recommended that messages not be sent with this format but it is known that some clients (Apple Mail is one) do send such mail.
   <LI> Avoid unnecessary re-sort of the folder when re-filtering in preparation for an expunge
   <LI> In PC-Pine, crash when fonts with unknown character sets are loaded
   <LI> Bug in composer when cleaning up a flowed message with indentations inside of quotes. 
   <LI> Preserve Literal-Signature leading spaces in config file
   <LI> Strip trailing spaces from signatures so that they won't be recognized as flowed text
   <LI> Fix race condition in rpdump that could cause overwriting of arbitrary local files owned by the user running rpdump if a malicious user has write permission in the same directory as the local file specified on the command line.
   <LI> When running Pine in function key mode, make it possible to Reverse the sort
</UL>

<P>
Version 4.62
addressed bugs found in previous releases and had a few additions as well.

<P>

  <LI> Some additional tokens having to do with the current date may be used in the folder name that is used as a target in a Filter Rule. For example, you may filter messages to a folder named for the current month by using the _CURYEAR_ and _CURMONTH_ tokens in the folder name. The (long) list of all such tokens is <A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.
  <LI> Three additional tokens for use with <A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A> may be used in the <A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A>. They are SUBJKEYINIT, KEY, and KEYINIT (in addition to the old SUBJKEY).
  <LI> Keywords may be displayed in color using <A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>, available from the Setup/Kolor screen
  <LI> The <A HREF="h_config_kw_braces">Keyword-Surrounding-Chars</A> option may be used to slightly modify the display of SUBJKEYINIT and SUBJKEY tokens.
  <LI> The <A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_kw_shortcut">Enable-Flag-Screen-Keyword-Shortcut</A> option adds a shortcut method of setting keywords
  <LI> When performing an aggregate reply (or forward), if the <a href="h_mainhelp_roles">Role</a> that would be selected when replying (or forwarding) to each individual message in the set is the same for all the messages, then that role is used just like it would be when replying (or forwarding) to any one of those messages.
  <LI> Delete/No Delete prompt added to Save command so that the source message may be deleted or not on a Save-by-Save basis
  <LI> <A HREF="h_config_status_msg_delay">Status-Message-Delay</A> option now allows reducing the status message delays Pine sometimes adds

  <LI> New feature <A HREF="h_config_sort_save_alpha">Sort-Default-Save-Alpha</A>
  <LI> For selecting messages by <A HREF="h_select_status">Status</A>, add the possibility of selecting based on Recent or Unseen status

</UL>

<P>
Bugs addressed in the 4.62 release included:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Crash when sending a message with a Role that sets the To header if the Empty-Header-Message is set to &lt;Empty Value&gt;
  <LI> Pine hangs in composer after alternate editor or speller is run and new mail arrives that causes an External Categorizer command to be executed
  <LI> Crash in MESSAGE INDEX when using a threaded sort. The crash is most common when the sort is Reversed.
  <LI> Pine could crash or hang when the window was resized down to 3 lines or fewer while in the composer
  <LI> In the Role editor the &quot;To Folders&quot; command for the &quot;Set Fcc&quot; action did not work
  <LI> After running Pine for a long time, it would slow down until restarted
  <LI> Export command in FOLDER LIST did not work with dual-use folders
  <LI> When the <A HREF="h_config_send_wo_confirm">Send-Without-Confirm</A> option was turned on, flowed text was not produced and the <A HREF="h_config_no_fcc_attach">Fcc-Without-Attachments</A> feature did not work
  <LI> Display bug, folder was not un-highlighted
  <LI> When viewing a message from the separate thread index, new mail arrival could cause Pine to leave the MESSAGE TEXT screen and drop back to the MESSAGE INDEX screen on its own
  <LI> When the UnDelete command was typed in the composer with the cursor in the middle of a header line, the text was inserted at the beginning of the line instead of at the location of the cursor
  <LI> When some messages from a thread were selected (not including the top of the thread), the view was Zoomed, and the feature <A HREF="h_config_slash_coll_entire">Slash-Collapses-Entire-Thread</A> was turned on; the collapse command caused messages to disappear from the view entirely
  <LI> Incorrect character conversions were possible when going from ISO-8859-X to ISO-8859-1
  <LI> <A HREF="h_config_quell_charset_warning">Quell-Charset-Warning</A> will now also quell the short comment included in header lines about the charset being different from yours in addition to quelling the editorial comment at the top of a message. This is the stuff that looks like &quot;[ISO-8859-2]&quot; in a header line.
  <LI> If the Down Arrow key was held down it caused Pine to do a new mail check for each repeated character, which caused a delay when the key was held down by mistake. Changed that so that it does at most one check per second.
  <LI> An unnecessary sort of the folder (causing a delay) was happening when closing if a filter rule depended on message state
  <LI> <A HREF="h_config_enable_mouse">Mouse in xterm</A> failed when clicking in the folder screen

  <LI> Crash caused by malformed ISO-2022-JP in header
  <LI> Crash when changing <A HREF="h_config_inbox_path">Inbox-Path</A> if INBOX was not the current folder
  <LI> Adding a collection on a Cyrus server did not work if the folder already existed (Pine tried to create it and failed)
  <LI> Pine gave incorrect messages when deleting dual-use folders/directories
  <LI> Saving an attached message to INBOX from another collection did not work correctly (it tried to create INBOX in the collection instead)
  <LI> In some circumstances, Pine could announce &quot;No messages expunged from folder &lt;x&gt;&quot; after an expunge command that actually worked correctly
  <LI> Allow alternate editor to use quoted arguments
  <LI> News drop folders weren't using the correct newsrc with <A HREF="h_config_enable_mulnewsrcs">Enable-Multiple-Newsrcs</A> enabled
  <LI> Error decoding some 8-bit headers, typically showing up as a garbage character at the end of a name
</UL>

<P>

Version 4.61
addressed bugs found in previous releases and had a few additions as well.

<P>
Additions included:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> The &quot;^T&quot; &quot;To Files&quot; command from within the composer on the Attchmnt header line or from within the composer in the &quot;^J&quot; &quot;Attach&quot; command is now capable of attaching multiple files at once
  <LI> When Exporting a message with attachments you now have the option of saving all of the attachments in a new directory (<A HREF="h_ge_allparts">Export Message File Selection</A>) by typing &quot;^P&quot; while exporting
  <LI> Feature to modify behavior of TAB command, <A HREF="h_config_tab_uses_unseen">Tab-Uses-Unseen-For-Next-Folder</A>
  <LI> When sending, flowed text (<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt">RFC 3676</A>) is sent by default. Now it is possible to turn off this behavior on a message by message basis with the ^V command at the Send prompt. You may still turn if off for all cases with the feature <A HREF="h_config_quell_flowed_text">Quell-Flowed-Text</A>.
  <LI> <A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_left">Viewer-Margin-Left</A> and <A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_right">Viewer-Margin-Right</A> made a little more flexible
  <LI> Suppress quoted text when viewing messages with <A HREF="h_config_quote_suppression">Quote-Suppression-Threshold</A>
  <LI> The behavior of the <A HREF="h_common_hdrmode">HdrMode Command</A> has changed slightly. It now reverts back to normal mode when you switch to a new message. It also has an additional state if <A HREF="h_config_quote_suppression">Quote-Suppression-Threshold</A> is turned on.
  <LI> The old behavior of the HdrMode Command can be restored by not setting the Quote-Suppression-Threshold and setting the new feature <A HREF="h_config_quell_full_hdr_reset">Quell-Full-Header-Auto-Reset</A>
  <LI> Feature to rename sent-mail folder to sent-mail-yyyy-mm instead of sent-mail-mon-year (<A HREF="h_config_prune_uses_iso">Prune-Uses-YYYY-MM</A>)
  <LI> With <A HREF="h_config_alt_role_menu">Alternate-Role-Menu</A> option turned on you could Reply or Forward using a Role. Now you can also Bounce using a role.
  <LI> Relaxed conditions which caused a filter to not be reevaluated before expunging if the user changed flags manually. Now only a manual Undelete may cause the filter to not be reevaluated before expunging.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs addressed in the 4.61 release included:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Crash when resizing screen in empty collection
  <LI> Crash with alternate-role-menu in empty folder
  <LI> Crash when you enter the name of a server incorrectly
  <LI> Crash when using aggregate Save and some attachments have been deleted
  <LI> Exit folder collection with &quot;&lt;&quot; command was broken
  <LI> Export command in FOLDER LIST did not always work
  <LI> Filtering on subject with non-ascii value did not work correctly
  <LI> Index display sometimes incorrect when threading
  <LI> Incorrect conversion from one 8-bit character set to another
  <LI> Saved-Msg-Name-Rule of &quot;last-folder-used&quot; broken in 4.60
  <LI> The threading-indicator-character would disappear when Expunging in some cases
  <LI> <A HREF="h_config_permlocked">Stay-Open-Folders</A> did not work with local folders
  <LI> Strip-From-Sigdashes-On-Reply was failing when replying to a non-flowed message with flowed-text enabled
  <LI> Sigdashes were incorrectly flowed for some flowed messages
  <LI> When building pine, compiling filter.c was broken or slow on some systems
  <LI> Features hide-nntp-path and disable-shared-namespaces weren't being correctly initialized
  <LI> Rule Patterns could only have a single category of Extra Headers
  <LI> The command to Replicate a rule did not copy the &quot;not&quot; parts of the rule correctly
</UL>

<P>

Version 4.60
was an evolutionary release which introduced some new functionality.

<P>
Additions included:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> In PC-Pine, add ability to do <A HREF="h_config_enable_pipe">piping</A>, <A HREF="h_config_sending_filter">Sending-Filters</A>, <A HREF="h_config_display_filters">Display-Filters</A>, and other operations where external command execution is possible.
  <LI> Control margins in Message Viewing screen with <A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_left">Viewer-Margin-Left</A> and <A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_right">Viewer-Margin-Right</A>
  <LI> Display flowed text well
  <LI> Send flowed text when possible, with the ability to turn this behavior off through the new feature <A HREF="h_config_quell_flowed_text">Quell-Flowed-Text</A>
  <LI> Add keywords to folders using the <A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A> option to set them up and the <A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag Command</A> to set or clear them for particular messages.

<H1>TLS and SSL Certificate Validation Failures</H1>

An attempt was made to establish a secure, encrypted connection to the
server system using either Transport Layer Security (TLS) or the older
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

<P>
An important part of this procedure is server certificate validation.  A
server certificate is an &quot;electronic identification card&quot; for the server
system which is signed by a well-known certificate authority (CA).  Pine
compares the server system identity in the server certificate with the
name of the server system to which it is trying to connect.  Pine also
verifies that the CA signature is authentic.

<P>
Some common failure conditions are:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI> [UNIX Pine] Self signed certificate.  This means that the server system
signed its own certificate.  This does not necessarily indicate anything
bad; the server operators may simply have elected to not purchase a
signed certificate from a certificate authority.

  <LI> [UNIX Pine] Unable to get local issuer certificate.  This means that
the signature on the server system is from an unknown certificate authority.
It can also mean that no certificate authority certificates have been
installed on the local UNIX system.

  <LI> [PC Pine] Self-signed certificate or untrusted authority.  This is
the same as either of the above two conditions in UNIX Pine.  Note that
Windows systems typically have a full set of certificate authority
certificates installed, so it is more likely to be a self-signed
certificate than an unknown certificate authority.

  <LI> Server name does not match certificate.  This means that the server
presented a proper signed certificate for a name other than the desired
name.
</UL>

<P>
Any of these conditions can indicate that you are being attacked and have
been directed to an imposter server that will record your password and
your private mail messages.  It can also mean something innocuous.

<P>
If you are certain that the problem is innocuous, you can append the
option

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/novalidate-cert</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

to the server system name where it appears in your configuration (e.g. the
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path">Inbox-Path</A>,
a folder-collection, or a news or SMTP server).  This will
disable certificate validation.  On the other hand, if you are attacked,
you will get no warning if you do this.

<P>
When using Pine from Unix or Windows 2000,
server certificates must be signed by a trusted certificate authority.
You may relax this requirement (at the cost of some security) by using
the
<A HREF="h_folder_server_syntax">NoValidate-Cert</A>
modifier in the mailbox name.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{foo.example.com/novalidate-cert}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>

The fully-qualified host name of the server should be used
so that it matches the host name in the server certificate.

<H2>Problems with INBOX CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR messages</H2>

We have recently discovered that a combination of bugs in TCP/IP
implementations can lead to these errors.  In particular, a problem
with Microsoft's WINSOCK used by PC-Pine and a different problem with
many Unix TCP implementations affecting IMAP server behavior may lead to
this error.  A workaround is to change the Mail-Check-Interval in the
pinerc file on your PC from the default value of 150 seconds to 50
seconds.
<P>
</UL>
Additional notes:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
While message folders may be either local or remote, Pine's support
files must, generally speaking, be located on your PC's local disk.
These files include Pine's configuration file (PINERC), signature file
(PINE.SIG), interrupted message folder, and debug files.  Two files that 
are by default also located on your PC's local disk <B>may</B> be instead 
located on a remote host:
<P>
<OL>
 <LI>  The postponed messages folder can be <A
 HREF="h_config_postponed_folder">defined in the Setup/Config</A> to be
 on an IMAP server.  This allows it to be accessible from both Unix
 Pine and PC-Pine thus allowing you to, for example, begin composing a
 message in Unix Pine, postpone it, and resume its composition later
 with PC-Pine, provided that <B>both</B> Pine configurations specify the
 <B>same</B> postponed messages folder location.  For example:
 <P>
 <CENTER><SAMP>{myIMAPhost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/postponed</SAMP></CENTER>

 <LI>It's also possible, depending on your local system configuration, to
 arrange remote access to your NEWSRC as well.  The advantage, as with
 the postponed message folder, is that both Unix Pine and PC-Pine can
 refer to the same information. See
 <A HREF="h_reading_news">Reading News</A>
 for more information.
</OL>

<P>
<LI> The PC-Pine message folder format is based on byte-counts for maximum
 efficiency, so they must not be edited. The format is non-standard, but
 conversion utilities would not be difficult. This format is supported in
 Unix Pine as well.

<H1>Pine Configuration</H1>

<H2>Using Environment Variables</H2>

The values of Pine configuration options may include environment variables
which are replaced by the value of the variable at the time Pine is run
(and also at the time the config option is changed).
The syntax to use environment variables is a subset of the common Unix
shell dollar-syntax.
For example, if

<P><CENTER><SAMP>$VAR</SAMP></CENTER><P>

appears in the value of a Pine configuration option it is looked up in the
environent (using getenv(&quot;VAR&quot;)) and its
looked-up value replaces the <SAMP>$VAR</SAMP> part of the option value.
To include a literal dollar sign you may precede the dollar sign with another
dollar sign.
In other words, if the text

<P><CENTER><SAMP>$$text</SAMP></CENTER><P>

is the value of a configuration option, it will be expanded to

<P><CENTER><SAMP>$text</SAMP></CENTER><P>

and no environment lookup will be done.
For Unix Pine it will also work to use a backslash character to
escape the special meaning of the dollar sign, but $$ is preferable since
it works for both PC-Pine and Unix Pine, allowing the configuration option
to be in a shared configuration file.
<P>

This all sounds more complicated than it actually is.
An example may make it clearer.
Unfortunately, the way in which environment variables are set is OS-dependent 
and command shell-dependent.
In some Unix command shells you may use

<P><CENTER><SAMP>PERSNAME="Fred Flintstone"</SAMP></CENTER><P>
   <CENTER><SAMP>export PERSNAME</SAMP></CENTER><P>

Now, if you use Pine's Setup/Config screen to set

<P><CENTER><SAMP>personal-name=$PERSNAME</SAMP></CENTER><P>

the <SAMP>$PERSNAME</SAMP> would be replaced by <SAMP>Fred Flintstone</SAMP>
so that this would be equivalent to

<P><CENTER><SAMP>personal-name=Fred Flintstone</SAMP></CENTER><P>

Note, environment variable substitution happens after configuration
options which are lists are split into the separate elements of the list,
so a single environment variable can't contain a list of values.

<P>
The environment variable doesn't have to be the only thing
after the equal sign.
However, if the name of the variable is not at the end of the line or
followed by a space (so that you can tell where the variable name ends),
it must be enclosed in curly braces like

<P><CENTER><SAMP>${VAR}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

It is always ok to use the braces even if you don't need to.
<P>
It is also possible to set a default value for an environment variable.
This default value will be used if the environment variable is not
set (that is, if getenv(&quot;VAR&quot;) returns NULL).
The syntax used to set a default value is

<P><CENTER><SAMP>${VAR:-default value}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

If the config file contains

<P><CENTER><SAMP>personal-name=${VAR:-Fred Flintstone}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

then when Pine is run <SAMP>VAR</SAMP> will be looked up in the environment.
If <SAMP>VAR</SAMP> is found then <SAMP>personal-name</SAMP> will have
the value that <SAMP>VAR</SAMP> was set to, otherwise,
<SAMP>personal-name</SAMP> will be set to <SAMP>Fred Flintstone</SAMP>,
the default value.

<P>
An example where an environment variable might be useful is the
variable <SAMP>Inbox-Path</SAMP> in the global configuration file.
Suppose most users used the server

<P><CENTER><SAMP>imapserver.example.com</SAMP></CENTER><P>

but that there were some exceptions who used

<P><CENTER><SAMP>altimapserver.example.com</SAMP></CENTER><P>

In this case, the system manager might include the following line in
the systemwide default Pine configuration file

<P><CENTER><SAMP>Inbox-Path=${IMAPSERVER:-imapserver.example.com}</SAMP></CENTER><P>

For the exceptional users adding

<P><CENTER><SAMP>IMAPSERVER=altimapserver.example.com</SAMP></CENTER><P>

to their environment should work.
<P>
Another example might be the case where a user has to use a different
SMTP server from work and from home.
The setup might be something as simple as

<P><CENTER><SAMP>smtp-server=$SMTP</SAMP></CENTER><P>

or perhaps a default value could be given.
Note that, as mentioned above, the variable <SAMP>SMTP</SAMP> cannot contain
a list of SMTP servers.
<P>

<H2>Configuration precedence</H2>

There are several levels of Pine configuration.  Configuration values at
a given level override corresponding values at lower levels.  In order of
increasing precedence:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI> built-in defaults
 <LI> system-wide
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
      config file from command line or provided
      by "PINECONF" environment variable
<!--chtml else-->
      pine.conf file
<!--chtml endif-->
 <LI> personal configuration file
 <LI> personal exceptions configuration file
 <LI> command-line options
 <!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"--><!--chtml else-->
 <LI> system-wide pine.conf.fixed file<!--chtml endif-->
</UL>
<P>
The values in both the personal configuration file and the
<A HREF="h_config_exceptions">exceptions</A>
configuration file may be set using the Setup command.
Setup/Config is the command to change most of the personal configuration
options.
The other Setup subcommands are also used to change the configuration,
for example, Setup/AddressBook, Setup/Rules, and so on.
Changing the personal exceptions configuration is very similar.
To change a value in the Config screen you would use the command
Setup/eXceptions/Config.
Likewise for the other Setup subcommands (Setup/eXceptions/Rules and so on).
<P>
There are a couple exceptions to the rule that configuration values are replaced
by the value of the same option in a higher-precedence file.
The Feature-List variable has values that are additive, but can be
negated by prepending &quot;no-&quot; in front of an individual feature name.
So for features, each individual feature's value is replaced by the value
of the same feature in a higher-precedence file.
Note that this is done automatically for you when you change these values via
the Setup/Config command.
The other exception to the <EM>replace</EM> semantics happens when you
use <A HREF="h_config_inheritance">configuration inheritance</A>
for option lists.
<P>

<H2>File name defaults</H2>

Notes:<P>

<BR> &lt;exe dir&gt; = directory where pine.exe found.
<BR> &lt;pinerc dir&gt; = directory where pinerc found.
<BR> # = default file name is overridable in pinerc.
<BR> $HOME, if not explicitly set, defaults to root of the current drive.
<BR> $MAILCAPS, if set, is used in lieu of the default mailcap search paths.
<BR> + between the mailcap paths implies that the two files are combined.
<BR> ; between other default paths implies that the first one found is used.
</P>
Pine looks for most support files in the same directory it finds its
personal configuration file (pinerc).  The -p command-line flag may be
used to specify a particular path name for the pinerc file.  If a
pinerc file does not exist, it will be created (if directory permissions
allow).  In PC-Pine, if -p or $PINERC are not defined, Pine will look
in $HOME&#92;PINE and the directory containing the PINE.EXE.  If a PINERC
file does not exist in either one, it will create one in the first of those
two directories that is writable.  In detail:

<H2>Mailcap files</H2>

Pine honors the mailcap configuration system for specifying external
programs for handling attachments.  The mailcap file maps MIME attachment
types to the external programs loaded on your system which can display
and/or print the file.  A sample mailcap file comes bundled with the Pine
distribution.  It includes comments which explain the syntax you need to
use for mailcap.  With the mailcap file, any program (mail readers,
newsreaders, WWW clients) can use the same configuration for handling
MIME-encoded data.
<P>

<H2>MIME-Types files</H2>

Pine uses mime-types files (.mime.types or MIMETYPE) to determine
what Content-Type to use for labeling an attached file, based on
the file extension.  That is, this file provides a mapping between
filename extensions and MIME content-types.
<P>

<H2>Environment variables</H2>

PC-Pine uses the following environment variables:
<DL>
<DT>PINERC</DT>
<DD>Optional path to pinerc file.</DD>
<DT>PINERCEX</DT>
<DD>Optional path to personal exceptions configuration file.</DD>
<DT>PINECONF</DT>
<DD>Optional path to global pine config file.</DD>
<DT>HOME</DT>
<DT>TMPDIR, TMP, or TEMP</DT>
<DT>COMSPEC</DT>
<DT>MAILCAPS</DT>
<DD>A <B>semicolon</B> delimited list of path names to mailcap files.</DD>
<DT>USER_DICTIONARY</DT>
<DD>Used to specify the file to contain the user's spell check
dictionary.  The default is <SAMP>DICT.U</SAMP> in the same
directory as the <SAMP>SPELL32.DLL</SAMP></DD>
</DL>

Unix Pine uses the following environment variables:
<DL>
<DT>TERM</DT>
<DD>Tells Pine what kind of terminal is being used.</DD>
<DT>DISPLAY</DT>
<DD>Determines if Pine will try to display IMAGE attachments.</DD>
<DT>SHELL</DT>
<DD>If not set, default is &quot;/bin/sh&quot;.</DD>
<DT>TMPDIR, TMP, or TEMP</DT>
<DT>MAILCAPS</DT>
<DD>A <B>colon</B> delimited list of path names to mailcap files.</DD>

<H2>Common PC-Pine Configuration Problems</H2>

<H3>Configuration settings aren't being saved</H3>

<P>This problem can happen if you run pine from one directory and
then decide to move your pine directory to another location.  PC-Pine
stores certain variables, including the configuration location, in the
Windows Registry (which you shouldn't ever need to manually edit).  There
are a couple of ways to go about removing or resetting the values in the
registry.

<P>
1) Run PC-Pine's registry value deletion command.  This can be done by
running: &quot;&lt;your&nbsp;pine&nbsp;directory&gt;&#92;pine.exe&nbsp;-registry&nbsp;clear&quot; from the DOS
prompt. You could create a shortcut to pine.exe and change the &quot;Target&quot;
value to the above command.

<P>
2) Tell PC-Pine where to look for the configuration file.  Configuration
information is stored in a file called the PINERC.  With the &quot;-p&nbsp;PINERC&quot;
option, you can tell PC-Pine the location of your pinerc.  An example of
this would be to run: &quot;&lt;your&nbsp;pine&nbsp;directory&gt;&#92;pine.exe&nbsp;-p&nbsp;C:&#92;pine&#92;mypinerc&quot;.
Again, you can use the DOS prompt or the shortcut method explained in (1).

<P>
Additionally, there is the &quot;-registry&nbsp;set&quot; option, which will actively
set registry values to the current setting, and is therefore useful with
the &quot;-p&nbsp;PINERC&quot; option.

<TITLE>Information on mbox driver</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Information on &quot;Missing Mail&quot; and the &quot;mbox&quot; driver</H1>

Beginning with Pine 4.00 (but also with earlier versions of the
University of Washington's imapd server), a new INBOX access method is
available as part of the standard configuration.  It is called the
&quot;mbox&quot; driver and it works like this:<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the file &quot;mbox&quot; exists in the user's home directory, and
is in Unix mailbox format, then when INBOX is opened this file will be
selected as INBOX instead of the mail spool file.  Messages will be
automatically transferred from the mail spool file into the mbox
file. Beginning with Pine 4.01, a message is displayed whenever Pine
copies messages from the system mail spool directory to the mbox
file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The advantage of this method is that, after new mail has been copied
from the system mail spool, all subsequent access is confined to the
user's home directory, which is desirable on some systems.  However, a
possible disadvantage is that mail tools other than those from the
University of Washington will not know to look for mail in the user's
mbox file.  For example, POP or IMAP servers other than those from the
University of Washington, and many &quot;new mail notification&quot;
programs may not work as expected with this driver enabled.<P>

To disable this behavior, either remove/rename the &quot;mbox&quot;
file or find the <A HREF="h_config_disable_drivers">Disable-These-Drivers</A>
option in Setup/Config
and add &quot;mbox&quot; to it:

<TITLE>FAQs on Pine Locking</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>What Systems Managers Need to Know about Pine File Locking</H1>

There is an extensive section on locking in the Pine technical notes;
this information is intended to provide answers to some common questions:<P>
<OL>
<LI> Why did locking change in Pine 4.00?<BR>
The actual locking mechanisms did not change in 4.00.
What changed is that when one particular locking mechanism used by Pine 
fails, Pine now issues a warning message.  Prior to 4.00, the locking
failure would occur, but no warning was issued.<P>

<LI> Is this what the &quot;Mailbox vulnerable&quot; message is about?<BR>
Yes.  It means that Pine was unable to create a lockfile in the
spool directory, generally because of overly restrictive protections on the
spool directory.  The correct permissions on the spool directory for
running Pine are 1777, i.e. read-write-execute permission for everyone,
with the sticky-bit set, so only owners of a file can delete them.<P>

<LI> Why does Pine require that the mail spool directory have 1777
   protections?<BR>
Pine was designed to run without special privileges.  This means that in
order to create a lockfile in the spool directory, it is necessary to have
the spool directory permissions be world-writable.<P>

<LI> Can't you create the lockfile somewhere else?<BR>
No.  The lockfile in question must be in the mail spool directory, because
that's where the mail delivery program expects to find it, and the purpose
of the file is to coordinate access between the mail client (Pine) and the
mail delivery program.<P>

<LI> Isn't having the spool directory world-writable a big security risk?<BR>
No.  Remember that the individual mail files in the spool directory are
NOT world-writable, only the containing directory.  Setting the &quot;sticky
bit&quot; -- indicated by the &quot;1&quot; before the &quot;777&quot; mode 
-- means that only the owner of the file (or root) can delete files in the 
directory.  So the only bad behavior that is invited by the 1777 mode is that 
anyone could
create a random file in the spool directory.  If the spool directory is
under quota control along with home directories, there is little incentive
for anyone to do this, and even without quotas a periodic scan for
non-mail files usually takes care of the problem.  <P>

<LI> Why not run Pine as setgid mail?<BR>
Pine was never designed to run with privileges, and to do so introduces a
significant security vulnerability.  For example, if a user suspends Pine,
the resulting shell will have group privileges.  This is one example of
why we strongly recommend against running Pine as a privileged program.
In addition, a &quot;privileged mailer &quot paradigm would mean that normal 
users
could not test Pine versions or other mailers that had not been installed
by the system administrators.<P>


<LI> Are there any alternatives to creating .lock files in the spool dir?<BR>
There are, but they all have different sets of tradeoffs, and not all will
work on all systems.  Some examples:<UL>
 <LI> Use lock system calls.  Works fine on a few systems, provided mail
   spool is local.   Doesn't work reliably if NFS is used.
   Doesn't work unless <B>all</B> the mail programs accessing the spool dir
   use the same calls.
 <LI> Deliver mail to user's home directory.  An excellent solution, highly
   recommended -- but one which is incompatible with some &quot;legacy&quot; 
mail tools that always look in the spool directory for the mail.
</UL><P>

<LI> Are these spool directory lock files the only kinds of locks used by
   Pine?<BR>
No.  Pine also creates lockfiles in the /tmp directory.  For normal Unix
mailbox format folders, these are used to coordinate access between
multiple Pine sessions.  <P>

<LI> What about the 
<A HREF="h_config_quell_lock_failure_warnings">&quot;Quell-Lock-Failure-Warnings&quot;</A> feature added in Pine 4.01?<BR>
This is for people who are content to live dangerously, or who have
specific knowledge that the spool directory lockfiles are superfluous on
their system (because both Pine and the mail delivery program are using 
system call file locking in a context that works reliably, e.g. not NFS.)<P>

<LI> Where can I find more details on how Pine locking works?<BR>
See the Pine Technical Notes.<P>

<H1>Requesting help</H1>
If the internal help, the Release Notes, the Pine Information Center, and your 
local online and print resources do not help you resolve a problem, please
start by contacting your local computer support staff and asking for help.
<p>
This is especially true if:
<ul>
  <li>You suddenly have trouble sending or receiving mail.
  <li>You receive a "disk quota exceeded" message.
  <li>You have forgotten your password.
  <li>You think your account may have been compromised.
  <li>You need help viewing an attachment.
  <li>You need to know how to configure your:

  <li>You want to block email from a particular person.
  <li>You're going on vacation and need to autorespond to incoming mail.
  <li>You want to automatically file or filter incoming messages.
</ul>

In all of these cases,
you should contact <B>your</B> support staff, because <B>only they</B> 
will be able to assist you effectively. Your support staff may be, depending on who 
provides you with the email account you use Pine with, for example:<UL>
<LI> the computing help desk of (a department of) your university, school, 
employer, ... ; or
<LI> the customer service center of your Internet Service Provider; or
<LI> the friendly volunteer helpers of your Freenet; or
<LI> the person who setup your computer and internet connection.

<H1>Introduction</H1>

Pine&reg; is the University of Washington's &quot;Program for Internet
News and Email&quot;.  It is intended to be an easy-to-use program for
sending, receiving, and filing Internet electronic mail messages and
bulletin board (Netnews/Usenet) messages. Pine supports the following
Internet protocols and specifications: SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol), 
NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol), MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions), IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), and LDAP (Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol).<p>

Although originally designed for inexperienced email users, Pine has
evolved to support many advanced features.  There are an ever-growing
number of configuration and personal-preference options, though which of
them are available to you is determined by your local system managers. 

<H2>WHAT PINE DOES...</H2>

Pine is a &quot;mail user agent&quot; (MUA), which is a program that
allows you to
compose and read messages using Internet mail standards.  (Whether you
can correspond with others on the Internet depends on whether or not your
computer is connected to the Internet.)  Pine also allows reading and
posting messages on the Internet &quot;net news&quot; system, provided
that your site operates a suitable news server.

<H2>WHAT PINE DOES NOT DO...</H2>

A &quot;mail user agent&quot; such as Pine is just one part of a
messaging system. Here are some things that are <B>not</B> done by Pine,
but require other programs:<P>
<UL>
 <LI> Actual relaying of email... which is done by &quot;message transfer 
agents&quot;.
 <LI> Vacation messages... automatically responding to incoming messages
 <LI> Anything to do with &quot;talk&quot;... which has nothing to do with 
email.
 <LI> Anything to do with &quot;irc&quot;... which has nothing to do with email.
 <LI> List processing... resending one message to a list of recipients.

<H1>Pine Help</H1>

Pine help is generally context-sensitive. In other words, each Pine screen you 
use will have its own help text, explaining the choices available for that
screen. This general help section, on the other hand, attempts to give an 
overall picture of what Pine is capable of doing, as well as pointers to 
additional help sections about specific topics.<p>

In addition to this general help on Pine, <A HREF="h_news">Release Notes</A>
on the current Pine version are also available from the MAIN MENU: Press
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F9&quot;
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;R&quot;
<!--chtml endif-->
to browse the release notes.  These include changes since the last release,
notes for PC-Pine, configuration information, the history of the Pine
project, credits, and legal notices.

<H1>Giving Commands in Pine</H1>

The bottom two lines of the screen are always used to list the
commands you can give.  You press the keys that are highlighted to give
the command.  The commands for getting help and going back to the main
menu are always present (except when viewing help as you are now).
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
<!--chtml else-->
<p>
Pressing O (meaning &quot;Other Commands&quot;) changes the keys
you see at the bottom of any screen. In some cases there are 3 or
even 4 different
sets of keys that can be seen by using the O key. <EM>All commands are 
active</EM>, even if they are not currently showing at the bottom of your 
screen. In other words, you <EM>never</EM> need to press the O key, except to 
remind yourself of the proper key to press to perform an operation.

<H2>Control Key Commands</H2>
When composing mail, and in a few other places, in Pine you
have to use Control keys. This means pressing the Control key (usually labeled 
&quot;Ctrl&quot;) and the
letter indicated at the same time.  Usually, this is shown with a
&quot;^&quot; in front of the letter.  On some systems, certain control
characters are intercepted before they get to Pine.  As a work-around,
you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the desired key.  For
example, if Ctrl-O (^O) does not work on your system, try typing
&quot;ESC ESC O&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
<H2>Paging Up and Down</H2>
The &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; keys are used for
moving to the next or previous page.  The space bar is a synonym for
&quot;+&quot;.  You may also use Ctrl-V to page down and Ctrl-Y to page
up as you do in the message composer.  On screens with a WhereIs (search)
command, W or Ctrl-W followed by Ctrl-V will move to the bottom of the
message or list, and W or Ctrl-W followed by Ctrl-Y will move to the top
of the message or list.

<H2>Return Key</H2>
The return key is usually a synonym for a frequently used
command.  When viewing a message, there is currently not a default
command, so RETURN does nothing; when in the index, it is synonymous with
&quot;view msg&quot;. In the key menu at the bottom of the screen, whatever is
enclosed in square brackets [] is the same as the return key.

<H2>Control Keys Not Used By Pine</H2>
Most commands in Pine are single letters, with -- we hope -- some mnemonic 
value, but in places where Pine is expecting text input, e.g. in the composer or 
at prompts for file/folder names, control keys must be used for editing and 
navigation functions.
<P>

Pine has used nearly all the control keys available.  There are, however,
certain control keys that are reserved by other programs or for technical
reasons.  Pine does not use any of these keys:
<DL>
 <DT>Ctrl-S</DT> <DD>Used by Unix as &quot;stop output&quot;</DD>
 <DT>Ctrl-Q</DT> <DD>Used by Unix as &quot;resume output&quot;</DD>
 <DT>Ctrl-]</DT> <DD>Often used by Telnet as escape key</DD>
 <DT>Ctrl-&#92;</DT> <DD>Often used by Unix as &quot;Abort&quot;</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Note: Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q can be subject to 
<A HREF="h_special_xon_xoff">special handling</A>.
<P>
In addition, while the ESC key alone is not used for command input,
Pine will recognize two consecutive ESC key presses followed by a letter 
key as a substitute for control key input.  For example, the control key
<SAMP>Ctrl-X</SAMP> can alternatively be entered using the
three keystrokes: <SAMP>ESC&nbsp;ESC&nbsp;x</SAMP>.
This is useful if the communication program you are using
(e.g. Telnet) has its own, conflicting, idea of what certain control
characters mean.


<H2>Repainting the Screen</H2>
Sometimes what is displayed on the screen will be
incorrect due to noise on the phone line or other causes and you will want
to repaint the whole screen to make it correct.  You can use the Ctrl-L
command to do this.  It never hurts to do it when in doubt.

<H1>Status Line</H1>

The top line of the screen is Pine's status line.  It will always display
the current version of Pine and will also convey information about the
status of the program.  This is where you look to find out what
collection, folder and message number is active.
<P>

If the top line says &quot;READONLY&quot; it means that the open folder
(typically your INBOX) is &quot;locked&quot; by another mail session --
most likely a more recent session of Pine has taken the INBOX lock.
<P>

If the top line says &quot;CLOSED&quot; it means that you are trying to
access a
folder on a remote mail server, and for some reason, communication with
the mail server has either been lost, or never successfully established.
This can be a result of trying to open a non-existent folder, or one
stored on an invalid or non-operational server, or it can mean that Pine
has been suspended for more that 30 minutes while accessing a remote mail
server.

<P>

From the Main Menu you can choose to read online help, write (compose) and 
send a message, look at an index of your mail messages, open or maintain
your mail folders, update your address book, configure Pine, and quit Pine.

As you use email, you can build a list of your regular email correspondents 
in your Pine
Address Book. At the Pine Main Menu, press A to see the Address Book List 
screen. Your
personal address book will be highlighted. Press &lt;Return&gt; to view it.
You can use the address book to store email addresses for individuals or
groups, to create easily
remembered &quot;nicknames&quot; for these addresses, and to quickly retrieve an email 
address when you are composing a message.
<P>
There are two ways to add addresses to your address book: you can add them 
manually or take them from messages (by pressing T to access the Take command). 
With either method, you specify nicknames for your correspondents. A single 
address book entry (or nickname) can point to just one email address, or, it can
point to more than one. When it points to more than one, it is called a 
distribution list. Each distribution list has a nickname, a full name, and a 
list of addresses. These
addresses may be actual addresses, other nicknames in your address book, or 
other
distribution lists.

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a standard means of accessing

sent directly to you (i.e., it is not a
copy or from a list).
<P>
The second column may be blank, or it may contain:
<ul>
  <li>"N" if the message is new (unread), </li>
  <li>"A" if you have answered the message (using the Reply command), </li>
  <li>"D" if you have marked the message for deletion.</li>
</ul>

<P>
Note: If you answer a message as well as mark it deleted (in either order), 
you will only see the &quot;D&quot;.

<P>
The rest of the columns in the message line show you the message
number, date sent, sender, size, and subject. For details, press ? (Help).  
The behavior and appearance of the Index screen is highly configurable.
In the Setup/Config screen search (with the WhereIs command) for options
which contain the words &quot;index&quot; or &quot;thread&quot; to see
many of the configuration possibilities.
<P>
Most of the commands you need to handle your messages are visible at the
bottom of the screen, and you can press O (OTHER CMDS) to see additional

<H1>Folders</H1>

Messages can quickly accumulate in your INBOX folder. If you use email
often, you soon could have hundreds. You need to delete messages you do
not want, and you can use folders to organize messages you wish to save. A
folder is a collection of one or more messages that are stored (just like
the messages in your INBOX) so you can access and manage them.

<P>
You can organize your email messages into different folders by topic,
correspondent, date, or any other category that is meaningful to you. You
can create your own folders, and Pine automatically provides three:
<ul>
  <li>The INBOX folder: messages sent to you are listed in this folder.
      When you first start Pine and go to the Message Index screen, you are
looking at the list of messages in your INBOX folder. Every incoming
message remains in your INBOX until you delete it or save it in another
folder. </li>
  <li>The sent-mail folder: copies of messages you send are stored in this 
folder. This is
convenient if you cannot remember whether you actually sent a message and want 
to check, or
if you want to send a message again.</li>
  <li>The saved-messages folder: copies of messages you save are stored in this 
folder
unless you choose to save them to other folders you create yourself.</li>

For example, you may color things like the titlebar, the current item,
the keymenu, and the status messages.
You may also color lines in the index, and headers and quoted text in the

The software which actually delivers mail (the stuff that happens

than Pine itself.
If possible, you may want to look into using that sort of mail filtering to
deliver mail to different folders, delete it, or forward it.
However, if you'd like Pine to help with this, Pine's filtering is for you.

<P>
Filtering is a way to automatically move certain messages from one folder
to another or to automatically delete messages.
You may also automatically set the state (Important, Deleted, ...) of messages.
Pine doesn't have the ability to forward mail to another address.

<H1>Aggregate Operations</H1>

When you are in the MESSAGE INDEX, the available commands
(for example, Delete, Undelete, Save, Reply, and so on)
normally act on a single message.
So, for example, if you press the Delete command, the currently highlighted
message is marked Deleted.
These commands that normally act on a single message may be applied to
several messages at once instead.
<P>
In order to use aggregate operations the feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set</A>
must first be turned on.
When this feature is turned on, the four commands &quot;Select&quot;,
&quot;SelectCur&quot;, &quot;ZoomMode&quot;, and &quot;Apply&quot;
are available.
The two selection commands allow you to mark a set of
messages as being &quot;selected&quot;.
The &quot;ZoomMode&quot; command will toggle between
displaying only the selected messages and displaying all the messages.
The &quot;Apply&quot; command allows you to
apply one of the regular MESSAGE INDEX commands to all of the selected
messages instead of to only the highlighted message.
<P>
An example aggregate operation would be to catch up when reading
a news group.
That is, get rid of all the messages in the news group so that you can
start fresh.
The easiest way to do this in Pine is to use aggregate operations.
You want to Delete all of the messages in the group.
You could start at the top and type &quot;D&quot; once for every message.
A faster method is to first Select all of the messages in the group,
and then Delete all of them.
This would take four keystrokes:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>; a (to select all messages)</SAMP></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><SAMP>a d (to delete all selected messages)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Another use of Select is to use it for searching for a particular message
or set of messages in a large folder.
You may know that the message was From a certain user.
You could select all messages from that user to start, and use Zoom to
look at only those messages.
If there were still too many messages to look at you could Narrow the
set of messages further by selecting from all of those messages only
the ones that were after a certain date, or contained a particular phrase
in the Subject, or were too a particular address, and so on.
That may be the end of what you are doing, or you may want to use Apply to
Save or Forward or Print all of the selected messages.

<H2>Configuring Pine for Reading News</H2>
Pine often arrives
pre-configured by your system administrator to automatically access the
newsgroups offered by your organization, Internet Service Provider, or
school. PC-Pine users, and those attempting to customize Unix Pine, will
need additional details on <a href="h_configuring_news">how to
configure Pine to read news</a>.

<H2>Accessing Newsgroups</H2>
The first step in reading news is to access the newsgroups collections
screen from Pine. If everything is configured properly, you should be able
to do this by first typing L (folder List), then selecting the folder
collection listed as "News." The actual name of this collection may differ
from system to system.

<H2>Subscribing to Newsgroups</H2>

Once you have accessed the news collection, you need to subscribe to a
newsgroup that interests you. Subscribing to a newsgroup means that Pine
will keep a record of the newsgroups in which you are interested and which
articles in those newsgroups have been read.

<H2>Using Newsgroups</H2> 
Pine uses the similar commands to read news as to read mail. For example,
the D command marks messages as Deleted (or "Dismissed," if you prefer),
and the R command Replies to a news posting. Basically, Pine allows you to
read news as if it were mail, so you don't need to change the way you
interact with Pine.

<H1>Securing your Pine Session</H1>

By default, Pine will attempt to connect to an IMAP server on the normal
IMAP service port (143).
If the Pine you are using has been built to
support &quot;Transport Layer Security&quot; (TLS)
and &quot;Secure Sockets Layer&quot; (SSL) 
(check by clicking <A HREF="X-Pine-Config:">here</A>),
and the server offers the STARTTLS capability, then a secure (encrypted)
session will be established.

<H1>Reporting Problems</H1>

There are now literally millions of Pine users in over 50 countries.
The Pine development team has no funding to provide support to anyone
outside of the University of Washington.  However, we certainly want Pine
to be the best tool it can be, so we do want to know about problems. We
ask that you first read the relevant help screens and then seek
assistance from your own local support staff.  Once you are sure that your
difficulty is not a local configuration problem, you might look at the
help section explaining where to look for
<A HREF="h_finding_help">more information</A> and where to 
get assistance.
<P>

Please note: Pine has been adapted to several other operating systems
besides those directly supported by the University of Washington; see:

Possible starting arguments for Pine:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> <EM>[addresses]</EM>

<DD> Send-to:  If you give <EM>Pine</EM> an argument or arguments which
do not begin with a dash, <EM>Pine</EM> treats them as email addresses.
<EM>Pine</EM> will startup in
the composer with a message started to the addresses specified.
Once the message is sent, the <EM>Pine</EM> session closes.
Standard input redirection is allowed.
Separate multiple addresses with a space between them.
Addresses are placed in the &quot;To&quot; field only.
<P>

<DT> &lt; <EM>file</EM>

<DD> <EM>Pine</EM> will startup in the composer with <EM>file</EM> read
into the body of the message.
Once the message is sent, the <EM>Pine</EM> session closes. 
<P>

<DT> -attach <EM>file</EM>

<DD> Go directly into composer with given file attached.
<P>

<DT> -attachlist <EM>file-list</EM>

<DD> Go directly into composer with given files attached.
This must be the last option on the command line.
<P>

<DT> -attach_and_delete <EM>file</EM>

<DD> Go directly into composer with given file attached, delete when finished.
<P>

<DT> -aux <EM>local_directory</EM>

<DD> <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.
This tells <EM>PC-Pine</EM> the local directory to use for storing auxiliary
files, like debug files, address books, and signature files.  The pinerc may 
be local or remote.
<P>

<DT> -bail

<DD> If the personal configuration file doesn't already exist, exit.
This might be useful if the configuration file is accessed using some
remote filesystem protocol. If the remote mount is missing this will cause
<EM>Pine</EM> to quit instead of creating a new pinerc.
<P>

<DT> -c <EM>n</EM>

<DD> When used with the <CODE>-f</CODE> option, apply the <EM>n</EM>th context.
This is used when there are multiple folder collections (contexts) and you 
want to open a folder not in the primary collection.
<P>

<DT> -conf

<DD> Configuration: Prints a sample system configuration file to the
screen or standard output. To generate an initial system configuration 
file, execute

<PRE><CODE>
		pine -conf > <!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"-->
</CODE></PRE>
<P>

To generate a system configuration file using settings from an old
system configuration file, execute

<PRE><CODE>
		pine -P old-pine.conf -conf > <!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"-->
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
A system configuration file is not required.
<P>

<DT> -copy_abook &lt;<EM>local_abook_file</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>remote_abook_folder</EM>&gt;

<DD> Copy an address book file to a remote address book folder.
If the remote folder doesn't exist, it will be created.
If it exists but the first message in the folder isn't a remote address
book header message, the copy will be aborted.
This flag will not usually be used by a user.
Instead, the user will create a remote address book from within <EM>Pine</EM>
and copy entries from the local address book by using aggregate Save in
the address book screen.
<P>

<DT> -copy_pinerc &lt;<EM>local_pinerc_file</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>remote_pinerc_folder</EM>&gt;

<DD> Copy a pinerc configuration file to a remote pinerc folder.
If the remote folder doesn't exist, it will be created.
If it exists but the first message in the folder isn't a remote pinerc
header message, the copy will be aborted.
This flag may be useful to users who already have a local pinerc file and
would like to convert it to a remote pinerc folder and use that instead.
This gives a way to bootstrap that conversion without having to manually
reset all of the variables in the remote pinerc folder.
<P>

<DT> -create_lu <EM>addrbook sort-order</EM>

<DD> Create auxiliary LookUp (index) file for <EM>addrbook</EM> and sort
<EM>addrbook</EM> in <EM>sort-order</EM>, which may be <EM>dont-sort</EM>,
<EM>nickname</EM>, <EM>fullname</EM>, <EM>nickname-with-lists-last</EM>,
or <EM>fullname-with-lists-last</EM>.
Only useful when creating global or shared address books.
The settings of the features
<A HREF="h_config_disable_collate">Disable-Setlocale-Collate</A> and
<A HREF="h_config_enable_ctype">Enable-Setlocale-Ctype</A> have no
effect when using the create_lu command.
<P>

<DT> -d <EM>debug-level</EM>

<DD> Debug Level:  Sets the level of debugging information written by
<EM>Pine</EM>.
<EM>debug-level</EM> can be set to any integer 0-9.
A debug level of 0 turns off debugging for the session.
(Actually there are some levels higher than 9, but you probably don't
want to see them.)
<P>

<DT> -d <EM>keywords</EM>

<DD> You may use a more detailed version of the debugging flag to set
the debug level in separate parts of <EM>Pine</EM>.
The possibilities are flush, timestamp, imap=0..4, tcp, numfiles=0..31, and
verbose=0..9.
<EM>Flush</EM> causes debugging information to be flushed immediately to
the debug file as it is written.
<EM>Verbose</EM> is the general debugging verbosity level.
<EM>Timestamp</EM> causes timestamps to be added to the debug file, which
is useful when you are trying to figure out what is responsible for delays.
<EM>Numfiles</EM> sets the number of debug files saved.
<EM>Imap</EM> sets the debug level for the debugging statements related
to the conversation with the IMAP server, and more generally, for the
debugging related to <EM>Pine</EM>'s interaction with the C-Client library.
<EM>Tcp</EM> turns on some TCP/IP debugging.
<P>

<DT> -f <EM>folder</EM>

<DD> Startup folder:  <EM>Pine</EM> will open this folder in place
of the standard INBOX.
<P>

<DD> <EM>Pine</EM> will start up in the FOLDER INDEX
screen instead of the MAIN MENU.
<P>

Configuration equivalent:  <EM>Initial-Keystroke-List=i</EM>.
<P>

<DT> -I <EM>a,b,c,...</EM>

<DD> Initial Keystrokes:  <EM>Pine</EM> will execute this comma-separated
sequence of commands upon startup.
This allows users to get <EM>Pine</EM> to start in any
of its menus/screens.
You cannot include any input to the composer in the initial keystrokes.
The key &lt;Return&gt; is represented by a ``CR'' in
the keystroke list; the spacebar is designated by the letters ``SPACE''.
Control keys are two character sequences beginning with ``^'', such as
``^I''.
A tab character is ``TAB''.
Function keys are ``F1'' - ``F12'' and the arrow keys are ``UP'',
``DOWN'', ``LEFT'', and ``RIGHT''.
A restriction is that you can't mix function keys and character keys in this
list even though you can, in some cases, mix them when running <EM>Pine</EM>.
A user can always use only <EM>character</EM> keys in the startup list even
if he or she is using <EM>function</EM> keys normally, or vice versa.
If an element in this list is a string of characters surrounded by double
quotes (&quot;) then it will be expanded into the individual characters in
the string, excluding the double quotes.

FOLDER INDEX screen with the current message being the specified
message number.
<P>

<DT> -nosplash

<DD> <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.
This tells <EM>PC-Pine</EM> not to display the splash screen upon startup.
This may be helpful for certain troubleshooting or terminal server scenarios.
<P>

<DT> -o <EM>folder</EM>

<DD> Opens the INBOX (or a folder specified via the -f argument) ReadOnly. 
<P>

<DT> -p <EM>pinerc</EM>

<DD> Uses the named file as the personal configuration file instead of
<EM>~/.pinerc</EM> or the default PINERC search sequence <EM>PC-Pine</EM> uses.
Pinerc may be either a local file or a remote configuration folder.
<P>

<DT> -P <EM>pinerc</EM>

<DD> Uses the named file as the system wide configuration file instead of
<EM><!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"--></EM> on UNIX, or nothing on <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
Pinerc may be either a local file or a remote configuration folder.
<P>

<DT> -passfile <EM>passfile</EM>

<DD> This tells <EM>Pine</EM> what file should be used as the password file.
This should be a fully-qualified filename.
<P>

<DT> -pinerc <EM>file</EM>

<DD> Output fresh pinerc configuration to <EM>file</EM>, preserving the
settings of variables that the user has made.
Use <EM>file</EM> set to ``-'' to make output go to standard out.
<P>

<DT> -r

<DD> Restricted Mode:  For UNIX <EM>Pine</EM> only.
<EM>Pine</EM> in restricted mode can only send email to itself.
Save and export are limited.
<P>

<DT> -registry <EM>cmd</EM>

<DD> For <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only, this option affects the values of 
<EM>Pine</EM>'s registry entries.
Possible values for <EM>cmd</EM> are set, clear, and dump.
<EM>Set</EM> will always reset <EM>Pine</EM>'s registry 
entries according to its current settings.
<EM>Clear</EM> will clear the registry values.
<EM>Clearsilent</EM> will clear the registry values without any dialogs.
<EM>Dump</EM> will display the values of current registry settings.
Note that the dump command is currently disabled.
Without the -registry option, <EM>PC-Pine</EM> will write values into
the registry only if there currently aren't any values set.
<P>

<DT> -sort <EM>key</EM>

<DD> Sort-Key:  Specifies the order messages will be displayed in for the
FOLDER INDEX screen.
<EM>Key</EM> can have the following values: 
arrival, date, subject, orderedsubj, thread, from, size, score, to, cc,
arrival/reverse, date/reverse, subject/reverse, orderedsubj/reverse, thread/reverse,
from/reverse, size/reverse, score/reverse, to/reverse, and cc/reverse.
The default value is &quot;arrival&quot;.
The <EM>key</EM> value reverse is equivalent to arrival/reverse.
<P>

Configuration equivalent:  <EM>Sort-Key</EM>.
<P>

<DT> -url <EM>url</EM>

<DD> Open the given URL.
<P>

<DT> -v

<DD> Version:  Print version information to the screen.
<P>

<DT> -x <EM>exceptions_config</EM>

<DD> Configuration settings in the exceptions configuration override your normal
default settings.
<EM>Exceptions_config</EM> may be either a local file or a remote Pine configuration folder.
<P>

<DT> -z

<DD> Enable Suspend:  When run with this flag, the key sequence ctrl-z
will suspend the <EM>Pine</EM> session.
<P>

Configuration equivalent:  <EM>Enable-Suspend</EM> included in
<EM>Feature-List</EM>.
<P>

<DT> -<EM>option</EM>=<EM>value</EM>

<DD> Assign <EM>value</EM> to the config option <EM>option</EM>.
For example, <EM>-signature-file=sig1</EM> or
<EM>-Feature-List=signature-at-bottom</EM>.
Note:  Feature-List values are
additive and features may be preceded with no- to turn them off.
Also, as a special case, the &quot;Feature-List=&quot; part of that may be
omitted. For example, <EM>-signature-at-bottom</EM> is equivalent to
<EM>-Feature-List=signature-at-bottom</EM>.

<H1>CONFIGURING NEWS</H1>
Pine can access news folders in any one of three different ways:
<DL>
<DT>REMOTE NNTP</DT>
<DD>Using the Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) to
access news on a remote news server.  In this case the newsrc file is
stored on the machine where Pine is running.

<P>
To specify a remote news-collection accessed via NNTP use the
SETUP/collectionList screen's &quot;Add&quot; command.  Set the
Server: value to the NNTP server's hostname appended with the
communication method &quot;/service=NNTP&quot;, and set the Path:
value to the &quot;#news.&quot; namespace (without the quotes).  See
the &quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_server">Server:</A>&quot; field's
help text for a more complete explanation of access method, and the
&quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_path">Path:</A>&quot; field's help
text for a more complete explanation of &quot;namespace&quot;.
<P>
Instead of specifying a news-collection, you may simply set the
<A HREF="h_config_nntp_server">NNTP Server</A>
option, which will cause Pine to create a default news-collection for you.
Another NNTP option which may be of interest is
<A HREF="h_config_nntprange">NNTP-Range</A>.

<DT>REMOTE IMAP</DT>
<DD>Using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to
access news on a remote news server.  In this case, your newsrc file is
stored on the news server, in your home directory, so you must have an
account on the news server, but you would be running Pine on a different
machine.  The news server must be running an IMAPd server process. 

<P>
To specify a remote news-collection accessed via IMAP use the
SETUP/collectionList screen's &quot;Add&quot; command.  Set the
Server: value to the IMAP server's hostname, and set the Path: value
to the &quot;#news.&quot; namespace (without the quotes).  See the
&quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_path">Path:</A>&quot; field's help
text for a more complete explanation of &quot;namespace&quot;.

</DD>

<DT>LOCAL</DT>
<DD>Using local file access to the news database.  In this
case, your newsrc file is stored on the news server, in your home
directory, so you must have an account on the news server, and you would
be running Pine on the same machine.

<P>
To specify a local news-collection use the SETUP/collectionList
screen's &quot;Add&quot; command.  Leave the Server: value blank, and
set the Path: value to the &quot;#news.&quot; namespace (without the
quotes).  See the &quot;<A HREF="h_composer_cntxt_path">Path:</A>&quot;
field's help text for a more complete explanation of &quot;namespace&quot;.

</DD>
</DL>

<P>

NOTE: Should no news-collection be defined as above, Pine will
automatically create one using the Setup/Config screen's
&quot;NNTP-Server&quot; variable's value if defined.  The collection
will be created as a &quot;Remote NNTP&quot; as described above.

<P>

If you are a PC-Pine user, either option 1 (NNTP) or option 2 (IMAP) is
possible.  If you don't have an account on the news server, or if the news
server is not running an IMAP daemon, then you must use NNTP.  (If you are not
sure, ask your service provider, university, or company for help.)  In
this case, your Unix .newsrc file can be transferred to your PC.  A good
place to put it would be in the same directory as your PINERC file, under
the name NEWSRC, but you can 
<A HREF="h_config_newsrc_path">specify a different location</A>
via Pine's Setup/Config screen.

<H1>READING NEWS</H1>

Pine uses almost the same commands for manipulating news folders as for
mail folders.  This means, for example, that when you are done with a
message, you would use &quot;D&quot; to mark it as Deleted (or Dismissed,
if you prefer.)  This &quot;mail-like&quot; behavior differs from that of
most newsreaders, wherein a message is implicitly dismissed after you have
looked at it once. We strongly believe that Pine should offer as much
consistency as possible between mail and news, so the mail paradigm --
wherein a message does not magically disappear without explicit action by
the user -- is used for news as well. <P>

If you answer a message in a news folder, the index view will show the
&quot;A&quot; flag as usual; but the industry standard file Pine uses to
keep track of what news as been read has no way of storing this flag, so
it will not be preserved across sessions.  The Deleted flag is the only
one that is preserved when you leave and then return to a newsgroup.  As an
additional note on replies, when you Reply to a newsgroup message and say
you want to reply to all recipients, Pine will ask if you want to post the
message to all the newsgroups listed in the original message. <P>

If you would like Pine to mark more-or-less recent news messages as
&quot;New&quot;, then set the
<A HREF="h_config_news_uses_recent">&quot;News-Approximates-New-Status&quot;</A>
feature.  This will cause messages after the last one you have marked as
Deleted to appear with &quot;N&quot; status in the MESSAGE INDEX.  The
&quot;N&quot; status often makes it easier to distinguish later news
articles from those you've previously seen, but not yet disposed of via
the &quot;D&quot; key.  Note that this is an approximation, not an exact
record of which messages you have not seen.
<P>

A frequent operation in news-reading is &quot;catching up&quot; -- that
is, getting rid of all the messages in the newsgroup so that you can
&quot;start fresh.&quot;  The easiest way to do this in Pine is via the
Select command.  You would enter the following four keystrokes:
<tt>;aad</tt> to select all messaged, and then apply the delete (or
dismiss) command to all of them. Note that the <A
HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set&quot;</A>
feature must be enabled before you can use the Select command.

<H1>Remote Configuration</H1>

You may use the command line argument &quot;-p pinerc&quot; to tell
Pine to use a non-default configuration file.
There are two types of storage for configuration information.
<EM>Local</EM> configuration files are used by default.
These are just regular files on the UNIX system or on the PC.
The file &quot;<CODE>.pinerc</CODE>&quot; is the default for Unix Pine and the
file &quot;<CODE>PINERC</CODE>&quot; is the default for PC-Pine.
<EM>Remote</EM> configuration folders are stored on an IMAP server.
The advantage of using a remote configuration is that the same information
may be accessed from multiple platforms.
For example, if you use one computer at work and another at home, the same
configuration could be used from both places.
A configuration change from one place would be seen in both places.
To use a remote configuration you simply give a
<A HREF="h_valid_folder_names">remote folder name</A>
as the argument to the &quot;-p&quot; command line option.
The command line might look something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>pine -p {my.imap.server}remote_pinerc</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If there are special characters in the command shell you use, you may need to
quote the last argument (to protect the curly braces from the shell).
The command might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>pine -p &quot;{my.imap.server}remote_pinerc&quot;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You should choose a folder name for a folder that does not yet exist.
It will be created containing an empty configuration.
Do not use a folder that you wish to store regular mail messages in.
<P>
The Setup/RemoteConfigSetup command will help you convert from a local
configuration to a remote configuration.
It will create a remote configuration for you and copy your current local
configuration to it.
It will also help you convert local address books into remote address books
and local signature files into literal signatures contained in the
remote configuration file.
<P>
If the Setup/RemoteConfigSetup command doesn't do what you want, you
may copy a local pinerc file to a remote configuration folder by hand
by using the command line option &quot;-copy_pinerc&quot;.
<P>
Another command line option, which is somewhat related to remote
configuration, is the option &quot;-x exceptions_config&quot;.
The configuration settings in the exceptions configuration override
your default settings.
It may be useful to store the default configuration (the -p argument) remotely
and to have the exceptions configuration stored in a local file.
You might put generic configuration information in the remote configuration
and platform-specific configuration on each platform in the exceptions
configuration.
The arguments to the &quot;-p&quot; and &quot;-x&quot; options
can be either remote folders or local files.
<P>
There is another command line argument which works only with PC-Pine and
which may prove useful when using a remote configuration.
The option &quot;-aux local_directory&quot; allows you to tell PC-Pine where
to store your local auxiliary files.
This only has an effect if your configuration file is remote.
Some examples of auxiliary files are debug files, address book files, and
signature files.

<H1>Generic and Exceptional Configuration</H1>

If you use Pine from more than one platform it may be convenient
to split your configuration information into two pieces, a generic piece
and exceptions which apply to a particular platform.
For example, suppose you use Pine from home and from work.
Most of your configuration settings are probably the
same in both locations, so those settings belong in the generic settings
configuration.
However, you may use a different SMTP server and INBOX
from home than you do from work.
The
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;SMTP-Server&quot;</A>
and
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path">&quot;Inbox-Path&quot;</A>
options could be
part of your exceptional configuration so that they could be different in the
two places.
<P>
The command line option &quot;-x exceptions_config&quot;
may be used to split your configuration into generic and exceptional pieces.
&quot;Exceptions_config&quot; may be either local or remote.
The regular Pine configuration file will contain the generic data, and
&quot;exceptions_config&quot; will contain the exceptional data.
<P>
For Unix Pine, if you don't have a &quot;-x&quot; command line option,
Pine will look for the file &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot;
in the same local directory that the regular config file is located in (usually
the Unix home directory).
If the regular config file is remote (because the command line option
&quot;-p remote_config&quot; was used) then Unix Pine looks in the Unix home
directory for &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot;.
If the file does not already exist then no exceptions will be used.
You can force exceptions to be used by using the &quot;-x&quot; option or
by creating an empty &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot; file.
<P>
For PC-Pine, if you don't have a &quot;-x&quot; command line option,
PC-Pine will use the value of the
environment variable <CODE>$PINERCEX</CODE>.
If that is not set, PC-Pine will look for
the local file &quot;<CODE>PINERCEX</CODE>&quot;
in the same local directory that the regular config file is located in.
If the regular config file is remote (because the command line option
&quot;-p remote_config&quot; was used) then PC-Pine looks in the
local directory specified by the &quot;-aux local_directory&quot; command
line argument, or the directory <CODE>$HOME&#92;PINE</CODE>, or
in the <CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>directory<CODE>&gt;</CODE>.
<P>
When you have an exception configuration there is a new command
in the Pine Setup screen, Setup/eXceptions.
It toggles between exceptions and the regular configuration.
This is the usual way to make changes in your exceptional configuration data.
For example, you would type &quot;S&quot; for Setup, &quot;X&quot; for
eXception, then follow that with one of the Setup commands, like &quot;C&quot;
for Config or &quot;K&quot; for Kolor.
<P>
For most people, splitting the configuration information into two pieces is
going to be most useful if the generic information is accessed
<A HREF="h_config_remote_config">remotely</A>).
That data will be the same no matter where you access it from and if you
change it that change will show up everywhere.
The exceptional data will most commonly be in a local file, so that the
contents may easily be different on each computing platform used.
<P>
If you already have a local configuration file with settings you like
you may find that the command Setup/RemoteConfigSetup is useful
in helping you convert to a remote configuration.
The command line flag &quot;-copy_pinerc&quot;
may also be useful.

<HEAD>
<TITLE>Configuration Inheritance</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Configuration Inheritance</H1>

Configuration inheritance is a power user feature.
It is confusing and not completely supported by the configuration
user interface.
We start with an explanation of how configuration works in hopes of making
it easier to describe how inheritance works.
<P>
Pine uses a hierarchy of configuration values from different locations.
There are five ways in which each configuration option (configuration
variable) can be set.
In increasing order of precedence they are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> the system-wide configuration file.

<LI> the personal configuration file

<LI> the personal exceptions file

<LI> a command line argument

<LI> the system-wide <EM>fixed</EM> configuration file (Unix Pine only)
</OL>
<P>
The fixed configuration file is normally
<CODE><!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_FIXED_PATH"--></CODE>.
<P>
The system-wide configuration file is normally
<CODE><!--#echo var="PINE_CONF_PATH"--></CODE> for Unix Pine and is normally not
set for PC-Pine.
For PC-Pine, if the environment variable <EM>$PINECONF</EM> is set, that
is used for the system-wide configuration.
This location can be set or changed on the command line with the -P flag.
The system-wide configuration file can be either a local file or a
remote configuration folder.
<P>
For Unix Pine, the personal configuration file is normally the file
<CODE>.pinerc</CODE> in the user's home directory.
This can be changed with the -p command line flag.
For PC-Pine, the personal configuration file is in
<CODE>$PINERC</CODE> or <CODE>&lt;PineRC registry value&gt;</CODE> or 
<CODE>$HOME&#92;PINE&#92;PINERC</CODE> or
<CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>dir<CODE>&gt;&#92;PINERC</CODE>.
This can be changed with the -p command line flag.
If -p is used, the configuration data may be in a local file or a remote config
folder.
<P>
For Unix Pine, the personal exceptions configuration file is named
<CODE>.pinercex</CODE> and is in the same directory as the personal
configuration file, if that configuration file is not remote, and is in
the home directory if the personal configuration file is remote.
If the file exists, then exceptions are turned on.
If it doesn't, then you are not using exceptions.
Alternatively, you may change the location of the exceptions configuration
by using the command line argument &quot;-x &lt;exceptions_config&gt;&quot;.
Like the personal configuration data, exceptions_config may be
either local or remote.
<P>
For PC-Pine, the personal exceptions configuration file is named
<CODE>PINERCEX</CODE> and is in the same directory as the personal
configuration file unless the personal configuration file is remote.
In that case, it is in the local directory specfied by the
&quot;-aux local_directory&quot; command line argument.
(In the case that the personal configuration is remote and there is no
&quot;-aux&quot; command line argument, Pine searches for
a PINERCEX file in the directory <CODE>$HOME&#92;PINE</CODE> and
the directory <CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>dir<CODE>&gt;</CODE>.)
If the file exists, then exceptions are turned on.
If it doesn't, then you are not using exceptions.
You may change the location of the exceptions configuration
by using the command line argument &quot;-x &lt;exceptions_config&gt;&quot;.
or with the
environment variable <CODE>$PINERCEX</CODE> (if there is no &quot;-x&quot;
option).
<P>
To reiterate, the value of a configuration option is taken from the
last location in the list above in which it is set.
Or, thinking about it slightly differently, a default value for an option
is established in the system-wide configuration file (or internally by Pine
if there is no value in the system-wide file).
That default remains in effect until and unless it is overridden by a value in a
location further down the list, in which case a new &quot;default&quot;
value is established.
As we continue down the list of locations we either retain the
value at each step or establish a new value.
The value that is still set after going through the whole list of
configuration locations is the one that is used.
<P>
So, for example, if an option is set in the system-wide configuration
file and in the personal configuration file, but is not set in the
exceptions, on the command line, or in the fixed file; then the value
from the personal configuration file is the one that is used.
Or, if it is set in the system-wide config, in the personal config, not
in the exceptions, but is set on the command line; then the value
on the command line is used.
<P>
Finally we get to inheritance.
For configuration options which are lists, like &quot;SMTP-Server&quot; or
&quot;Incoming-Folders&quot;,
the inheritance mechanism makes it possible to <EM>combine</EM>
the values from different locations instead of <EM>replacing</EM> the value.
This is true of all configuration lists other than the &quot;Feature-List&quot;,
for which you may already set whatever you want at
any configuration location (by using the &quot;no-&quot; prefix if
necessary).
<P>
To use inheritance, set the first item in a configuration list to the
token &quot;INHERIT&quot;, without the quotes.
If the first item is &quot;INHERIT&quot;,
then instead of replacing the default value established so far, the rest of
the list is appended to the default value established so far and that is
the new value.
<P>
Here is an example which may make it clearer. Suppose we have:
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = INHERIT, mysmtp.home
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

This would result in an effective smtp-server option of
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com, mysmtp.home
</PRE>
<P>
The &quot;INHERIT&quot; token can be used in any of the configuration files
and the effect cascades.
For example, if we change the above example to:
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = INHERIT, mysmtp.home
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = INHERIT, yoursmtp.org
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

This would result in:
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com, mysmtp.home, yoursmtp.org
</PRE>
<P>
Unset variables are skipped over (the default value is carried forward) so
that, for example:
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = INHERIT, yoursmtp.org
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

produces:
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com, yoursmtp.org
</PRE>
<P>

If any later configuration location has a value set (for a particular list
option) which does <EM>not</EM> begin with &quot;INHERIT&quot;,
then that value replaces whatever value has been defined up to that point.
In other words, that cancels out any previous inheritance.
<P>
<PRE>
 System-wide config :   smtp-server = smtp1.corp.com, smtp2.corp.com
 Personal config    :   smtp-server = INHERIT, mysmtp.org
 Exceptions config  :   smtp-server = yoursmtp.org
 Command line       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
 Fixed config       :   smtp-server = &lt;No Value Set&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

results in:
<P>
<PRE>
 smtp-server = yoursmtp.org
</PRE>
<P>

For some configuration options, like &quot;Viewer-Hdr-Colors&quot; or
&quot;Patterns-Roles&quot;, it is
difficult to insert the value &quot;INHERIT&quot; into the list of values
for the option using the normal Setup tools.
In other words, the color setting screen (for example) does not
provide a way to input the text &quot;INHERIT&quot; as the first
item in the Viewer-Hdr-Colors option.
The way to do this is to either edit the pinerc file directly and manually
insert it, or turn
on the <A HREF="h_config_expose_hidden_config">Expose-Hidden-Config</A>
feature and insert it using the Setup/Config screen.

<H1>XOFF/XON Handling within Pine</H1>

By default, Pine treats Ctrl-S or Ctrl-Q (sometimes known as XOFF
and XON) as normal characters, even though Pine does not use them.
However, the printer, modem, or communication software you are using may
be configured for &quot;software flow control,&quot; which means that
XON/XOFF must be treated as special characters by the operating system.
If you see messages such as &quot;^S not defined for this screen&quot;,
then your system is probably using software flow control. In this case
you will need to set the
<A HREF="h_config_preserve_start_stop">&quot;Preserve-Start-Stop-Characters&quot;</A>
feature.
<P>
If you <EM>do</EM> set this
feature, be advised that if you accidentally hit a Ctrl-S, Pine will
mysteriously freeze up with no warning.  In this case, try typing a Ctrl-Q
and see if that puts things right.  Printing via the
&quot;attached-to-ansi&quot; or 
&quot;attached-to-wyse&quot;
option will automatically enable software
flow-control handling for the duration of the printing.

<H1>Email List Commands Explained</H1>

Electonic mail lists provide a way for like-minded users to join in
discussions on topics of interest.  The email list itself is 
represented by a
single address that participants send messages to when they have
something of interest to share with other members of the list.  The
receiving computer then, either automatically or after review by the
list's owner (or moderator), sends a copy of that message to each
member of the list.

<P>
Usually, subscribing and unsubscribing is done by sending requests in
an email message to a special address setup to handle managing list
membership.  Often this is the name of the list followed by
<I>-request</I>.  This address is almost <EM>never</EM> the same as
the address used to send messages to the list.

<P>
Unfortunately, email list participation commands are more a matter
of convention than standard, and thus may vary from list to list.
Increasingly, list management software is adding information to
the copy of the postings as they're copied to the list members that
explains how to do the various list management functions.

<P>
Pine will recognize this information and offer the management commands
they represent in a simple display. One or more of the following
operations will be made available:

<DL>
<DT>Help</DT>
<DD>
A method to get help on subscribing, unsubscribing, 
an explanation of what the list is about, or special instructions
for participation.  This may be in the form of a reply in response
to an email message, or instructions on how to connect to a Web site.
</DD>

<DT>Unsubscribe</DT>
<DD>
A method to get your email addressed removed from the list of
recipients of the email list.
</DD>

<DT>Subscribe</DT>
<DD>
A method to get your email address added to the list of recipients
of the email list.  It may be in the form of a message sent to 
a special address or you may be connected to a web site.
<DD>
</DD>

<DT>Post</DT>
<DD>
A method used to post to the email list.  However, it might also 
indicate that no posting is allowed directly to the list.
</DD>

<DT>Owner</DT>
<DD>
A method to contact the list owner for special questions you might
have regarding the list.
</DD>

<DT>Archive</DT>
<DD>
A method to view an archive of previous messages posted to the list.
This may be in the form of a mail folder on a remote computer, an
IMAP mailbox or even a Web site.

<H2>Description of the THREAD INDEX Screen</H2>

The THREAD INDEX displays summary information from each
thread (conversation) in the current folder.
This is useful if you want to quickly
scan new threads, or find a particular thread without having to go
through the text of each message, or to quickly get rid of junk
threads, etc.
The current thread is always highlighted.
Each line of the THREAD INDEX contains the following columns: <P>
<DL>
 <DT>STATUS:</DT>
 <DD> The markings on the left side of the thread tell you about its
status.  You may see one or more of the following codes on any given
thread:
<UL>
  <LI> &quot;D&quot; for Deleted. All of the messages in this thread are marked for deletion but not yet eXpunged from the folder.
  <LI> &quot;N&quot; for New. At least one message in the thread is New (you haven't looked at it yet).
  <LI> &quot;+&quot; for direct-to-you. The &quot;+&quot; indicates that a message in the thread was sent directly to your account, your copy is not part of a cc: or a mailing list.
  <LI> &quot;-&quot; for cc-to-you. The &quot;-&quot; indicates that a
	message in the thread was sent to you as a cc:. This symbol can only show up if
	you have turned on the feature
	&quot;<A HREF="h_config_mark_for_cc">Mark-For-CC</A>&quot;.
  <LI> &quot;X&quot; for selected.  You have selected at least one message in the thread by using the
	&quot;select&quot; command.  (Some systems may optionally allow selected
	messages to be denoted by the index line being displayed in bold
	type instead.)
  <LI> &quot;*&quot; for Important.  You have previously used the &quot;Flag&quot; command
      to mark at least one message in this thread as &quot;important&quot;.
</UL></DD><P>

 <DT>THREAD NUMBER:</DT>
 <DD>Threads in a folder are numbered, from one through the number
of threads in the folder, to help you know where you are in the folder.
</DD><P>

 <DT>DATE STARTED:</DT>
 <DD>The date the thread was started. This is actually from the Date header
of the first message in the thread. It doesn't take different time zones
into account.</DD><P>

 <DT>WHO STARTED THE THREAD:</DT>
 <DD>This is usually the name of the sender of the first message in the thread, taken from
the From header of the message.
If there is no personal name given in that
address, then the email address is used instead.
If the message is from you (or from one of your
<A HREF="h_config_alt_addresses">alternate addresses</A>),
then the recipient's name is shown here instead, with the characters
&quot;To: &quot; inserted before the name.
(The idea of this is that if you started the thread you would rather see who
the mail was sent to instead of that the mail was from you.)
In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed after the &quot;To: &quot;.
</DD><P>

 <DT>SIZE:</DT>
 <DD>The number in parentheses is the number of messages in the thread.</DD><P>

 <DT>SUBJECT:</DT>
 <DD>As much of the thread's subject line as will fit on the screen.
This is the subject of the first message in the thread.</DD>

<H2>Description of the MESSAGE INDEX Screen</H2>

The MESSAGE INDEX displays summary information from each
message in the current folder.
This is useful if you want to quickly
scan new messages, or find a particular message without having to go
through the text of each message, or to quickly get rid of junk
messages, etc.
The current message is always highlighted.
Each line of the MESSAGE INDEX contains the following columns (by default -- 
you can change this with the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A>&quot; option
in the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen): <P>
<DL>
 <DT>STATUS:</DT>
 <DD> The markings on the left side of the message tell you about its
status.  You may see one or more of the following codes on any given
message:
<UL>
  <LI> &quot;D&quot; for Deleted.  You have marked this message for deletion but not
	 yet eXpunged the folder.
  <LI> &quot;N&quot; for New.  You have not looked at the text of the message yet.
  <LI> &quot;A&quot; for Answered.  Any time you reply to a message it is considered
	 to be answered.
  <LI> &quot;+&quot; for direct-to-you.  The &quot;+&quot; indicates that a message was sent
	directly to your account, your copy is not part of a cc: or a
	mailing list.
  <LI> &quot;-&quot; for cc-to-you. The &quot;-&quot; indicates that a
	message was sent to you as a cc:. This symbol can only show up if
	you have turned on the feature
	&quot;<A HREF="h_config_mark_for_cc">Mark-For-CC</A>&quot;.
  <LI> &quot;X&quot; for selected.  You have selected the message by using the
	&quot;select&quot; command.  (Some systems may optionally allow selected
	messages to be denoted by the index line being displayed in bold
	type.)
  <LI> &quot;*&quot; for Important.  You have previously used the &quot;Flag&quot; command
      to mark this message as &quot;important&quot;.
</UL></DD><P>

 <DT>MESSAGE NUMBER:</DT>
 <DD>Messages in a folder are numbered, from one through the number
of messages in the folder, to help you know where you are in the folder.
These numbers are always in increasing order, even if you sort the folder
in a different way.</DD><P>

 <DT>DATE SENT:</DT>
 <DD>The date the message was sent.  By default, messages are
ordered by arrival time, not by date sent.  Most of the time, arrival time
and date sent (effectively departure time) are similar.  Sometimes,
however, the index will appear to be out of order because a message took a
long time in delivery or because the sender is in a different time
zone than you are. This date is just the date from the Date header
field in the message.</DD><P>

 <DT>WHO SENT THE MESSAGE:</DT>
 <DD>This is usually the name of the sender of the message, taken from
the From header of the message.
If there is no personal name given in that
address, then the email address is used instead.
If the message is from you (or from one of your
<A HREF="h_config_alt_addresses">alternate addresses</A>),
then the recipient's name is shown here instead, with the characters
&quot;To: &quot; inserted before the name.
(The idea of this is that if you sent the mail you would rather see who
the mail was sent to instead of that the mail was from you.
This behavior may be changed by modifying the Index-Format option mentioned
above.
In particular, use the FROM token or the FROMORTONOTNEWS token
in place of the FROMORTO token.)
In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed after the &quot;To: &quot;. </DD><P>

 <DT>SIZE:</DT>
 <DD>The number in parentheses is the number of characters in the message.</DD><P>

 <DT>SUBJECT:</DT>
 <DD>As much of the message's subject line as will fit on the screen.</DD>

<H2>Description of the MESSAGE TEXT Screen</H2>

The top line of the view message screen displays status
information about the currently open collection and folder and about the
current message.  It shows the name of the collection in angle brackets
and then the name of the folder.  The line also displays the number
of messages in the folder, the number of the current message and the
percentage of the current message that has been displayed on the screen.
If the message is marked for deletion &quot;DEL&quot; will appear in the upper
right corner.
If the message has been answered (but not deleted) &quot;ANS&quot; will show
in the corner.
<P>

NOTE: to rapidly move to the end of a message, hit the
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->W<!--chtml endif-->
(or Ctrl-W) key followed
by Ctrl-V.  Similarly,
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->W<!--chtml endif-->
followed by Ctrl-Y will take you to the beginning of
a message.

<H2>Explanation of Alternate Character Sets</H2>

Pine attempts to stay out of the way so that it won't prevent you from
viewing mail in any character set.  It will simply send the message to
your display device.  If the device is capable of displaying the
message as it was written it will do so.  If not, the display may be
partially or totally incorrect.  If the message is marked as being in
a character set other than &quot;US-ASCII&quot; and it is a character
set that is different from the set you have indicated with the
<A HREF="h_config_char_set">&quot;Character-Set&quot;</A>
variable in your configuration, then a warning message will be printed
to your screen at the beginning of the message display.<P>

In all cases Pine requires that the display device can handle the
character set.  For example, most X-terminals will display the ISO-8859-1
character set if the right font is selected.  VT220's and higher also
display ISO-8859-1.  Displays for other characters sets are less common.
<P>

Pine usually suppresses display of control characters in order to avoid
characters which may change terminal setup parameters.
If this is a problem for you, the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_pass_control">Pass-Control-Characters-as-is</A>&quot;
feature can be used to turn this behavior off.

<TITLE>Selecting: Select and WhereIs/Select</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Selecting: Select and WhereIs/Select</H1>

Aggregate operations give you the ability to process a group of messages
at once.  Acting on multiple messages requires two steps: (1) selecting a
set of messages and then; (2) applying a command to that set. The first
part is handled by the select command.  Select allows you to
select messages based on their status (read, answered, etc.), contents,
date, size, or keywords.
You may also select based on one of your Rules,
and there are quick options to select a specific message or range of messages,
to select the current message, or to select all messages.
<P>

We describe the various selection criteria briefly:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>select All</DT>
<DD> Marks all the messages in the folder as selected.
</DD>

<DT>select Cur</DT>
<DD> Selects the currently highlighted message.
</DD>

<DT>select by Number</DT>
<DD> Select by message number. This may be a comma-separated list instead of
a single entry.
Each element in the list may be either a single message number or a range
of numbers with a dash between the lowest and highest member of the range.
Some examples are 7 to select only message number 7; 2-5 to select messages
2 through 5; and 2-5,7-9,11 to select messages 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11.
</DD>

<DT>select by Date</DT>
<DD> Select by either the date stored in the Date headers of each message,
or by the date when the messages arrived.
This does not adjust for different time zones, but just checks to see what
day the message was sent on.
You may type in a date. If you do, the date should be in the form
<P><SAMP><CENTER>DD-Mon-YYYY</CENTER></SAMP><P>
For example,
<P><SAMP><CENTER>24-Nov-2004</CENTER></SAMP><P>
or
<P><SAMP><CENTER>09-Nov-2004</CENTER></SAMP><P>
If the date you want is close to the current date, it is probably
easier to use the &quot;^P&nbsp;Prev Day&quot; or &quot;^N&nbsp;Next Day&quot; commands to change the default date that
is displayed, instead of typing in the date yourself.
Or, the &quot;^X&nbsp;Cur Msg&quot; command may be used to fill in
the date of the currently highlighted message. 
<P>
There are six possible settings that are selected using the
&quot;^W&nbsp;Toggle When&quot; command.
Three of them select messages based on the Date headers.
They are &quot;SENT SINCE&quot;, &quot;SENT BEFORE&quot;,
and &quot;SENT ON&quot;.
SINCE is all messages with the selected date or later.
BEFORE is all messages earlier than the selected date (not including the day
itself).
ON is all messages sent on the selected date.
The other three select messages in the same way but they use the arrival
times of the messages instead of the Date headers included in the messages.
Those three are &quot;ARRIVED SINCE&quot;, &quot;ARRIVED BEFORE&quot;,
and &quot;ARRIVED ON&quot;.
When you save a message from one folder to another the arrival time is
preserved.
</DD>

<DT>select by Text</DT>
<DD> Selects messages based on the message contents.
This allows you to select a set of messages based on whether or not the
message headers or message body contain specified text.
You may look for text in the Subject, the From header,
the To header, or the Cc header.
You may also choose Recipient, which searches for the text in
either the To or the Cc header;
or Participant, which means To or Cc or From.
Besides those specific header searches, you may also search the entire
header and text of the message with &quot;All Text&quot;, or just the
body of the message.
<P>
To search for the absence of text, first type the &quot;! Not&quot; command
before typing the specific type of text search.
For example, you could type &quot;!&quot; followed by &quot;S&quot; to
search for all messages which do not contain a particular word in their
Subjects.
<P>
If you choose a Subject search, you may use the subject from the current
message by typing the &quot;^X Cur Subject&quot; command.
You may then edit it further if you wish.
For example, you might select the subject of a reply and edit the
&quot;Re:&nbsp;&quot; off of the front of it in order to search for
the original message being replied to.
All of the other header searches allow you to use addresses from the
headers of the current message if you want to.
You may use the &quot;^T Cur To&quot;, &quot;^R Cur From&quot;, or
&quot;^W Cur Cc&quot;.
In each case, if there is more than one address, only the first is offered.
</DD>

<DT>select by Status</DT>
<DD> Selects messages based on their status.
You may select all New, Important, Deleted, Answered, Recent, or Unseen
messages.
Or, if you first type the &quot;! Not&quot; command, you get not New,
or not Important, and so on.
If you select Deleted messages, you will get all messages with their
Deleted flag set.
Likewise for Important messages, all messages which you have flagged as
being Important with the
<A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag</A> command.
The &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Answered&quot; choices are a little bit odd
because they try to match what you see on the screen by default.
&quot;New&quot; is a shorthand for messages which are Unseen, Undeleted,
and Unanswered.
If you have looked at the message, or deleted it, or answered it; then it
is not considered &quot;New &quot;.
&quot;!&nbsp;New&quot; is the opposite of &quot;New&quot;.
<P>
&quot;Answered&quot; is another one that is a little different.
It means that the message has been Answered <EM>and</EM> is not deleted.
And to make it even more confusing, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; is not
the opposite of &quot;Answered&quot;!
Instead, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; stands for messages which are
both Unanswered <EM>and</EM> not deleted.
<P>
The other two types were added later because the special nature of the
New flag was not what was wanted by all users.
New does match what you see in the index by default, but if you use
the IMAPSTATUS token in the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A>&quot; it may not
be exactly what you want.
&quot;Unseen&quot; simply selects all unseen messages, whether or not
they are deleted or answered, and
&quot;Recent&quot; selects all of the messages which have been added to
the folder since you started this Pine session.
(That's not technically quite true. If there are multiple mail clients
reading an IMAP mailbox, each message will be marked as Recent in only
one of the client's sessions.)
</DD>

<DT>select by siZe</DT>
<DD> Selects messages based on their size being smaller than or larger
than the size you specify.
The size is the number of bytes.
You may use the suffix &quot;K&quot; or &quot;k&quot; to mean 1,000 times
the number.
For example, 7K is the same as 7000.
The suffix &quot;M&quot; or &quot;m&quot; means 1,000,000 times the number,
and the suffix &quot;G&quot; or &quot;g&quot; means 1,000,000,000 times.
Use the &quot;^W&quot; command to toggle back and forth between Smaller
and Larger.
</DD>

<DT>select by Keyword</DT>
<DD> Selects messages which either have or do not have
(using the &quot;!&nbsp;Not&quot; command)
a particular <A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keyword</A> set.
One way to select a keyword is to use the &quot;^T&nbsp;To&nbsp;List&quot;
command to select one from your list of keywords.
</DD>

<DT>select by Rule</DT>
<DD> Selects messages which either match or don't match
(using the &quot;!&nbsp;Not&quot; command)
one of the Rules you have defined.
The most likely method of filling in the Rule is to use the
&quot;^T&nbsp;To&nbsp;List&quot;
command to select one of your Rules.
All of the Rules you have defined will be in the list, including
Rules for Indexcolors, Filtering, Roles, Score setting, and Other.
They may not all make sense for this purpose, but they are all there for
flexibility.
You might even find it useful to define some rules solely for the purpose
of being used by the Select command.
There isn't a special category for such Rules (perhaps there ought to be).
Instead, you just define a Rule that does nothing.
For example, it could be an Indexcolor rule which comes after your
other Indexcolor rules and just sets the color to the Default color, which
is what would happen anyway.
Or it could be a SetScore rule with a score of zero.
<P>
Unfortunately, Pine does not allow all possible Rules to be defined.
For example, there is no logical OR operation.
OR is accomplished in the Filter Rules or the other types of Rules by
simply defining two rules, one that matches the first part of the OR
and another that matches the second part.
But you can't do that here, since you only have a single Rule to work with.
Likewise, the order of Rules is usually important.
For example, if the first Filter Rule (or Indexcolor rule or ...) matches
a message, then that stops the search for a further match.
This means that you may be confused if you try to use Select by Rule to
check your Filter rules because the order is important when filtering but
is not considered here.
</DD>
</DL>

After you have an initial selection, the next and subsequent selection
commands modify the selection.
The select command changes. It first gives
you selection &quot;alteration&quot; options: &quot;unselect All&quot;,
&quot;unselect Current&quot;,
&quot;Broaden selection&quot; (implements a logical OR), and
&quot;Narrow selection&quot; (implements a logical AND).
After you choose either Broaden or Narrow, you then choose one of the
selection criteria listed above (by Text or Number or ...).
You may use select as many times as you wish to get the selected set right.
<P>

Also, starting with Pine 4.00, the WhereIs command has a new feature 
(Ctrl-X) to
select all the messages which match the WhereIs search. WhereIs searches
through just the text which appears on the MESSAGE INDEX screen.
This method is often slower than using the select command itself, unless the
line you are looking for is not too far away in the index.
<P>

The availability of the aggregate operations commands is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Pine
configuration.
The features
<A HREF="h_config_auto_zoom">&quot;Auto-Zoom-After-Select&quot;</A>
and
<A HREF="h_config_select_wo_confirm">&quot;Select-Without-Confirm&quot;</A>
affect the behavior of the Select command.

If you have looked at the message, or deleted it, or answered it; then it
is not considered &quot;New &quot;.
&quot;!&nbsp;New&quot; is the opposite of &quot;New&quot;.
<P>
&quot;Answered&quot; is another one that is a little different.
It means that the message has been Answered <EM>and</EM> is not deleted.
And to make it even more confusing, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; is not
the opposite of &quot;Answered&quot;!
Instead, &quot;!&nbsp;Answered&quot; stands for messages which are
both Unanswered <EM>and</EM> not deleted.
<P>
(The New and Answered options may seem counter-intuitive.
The reason it is done this way is
because, by default, a Deleted message will show up with the &quot;D&quot;
symbol in the MAIL INDEX screen even if it is New or Answered.
The Delete symbol overrides the New and Answered symbols, because you
usually don't care about the message anymore once you've deleted it.
Similarly, you usually only care about whether a message is Answered or
not if it is not Deleted.
Once it is Deleted you've put it out of your mind.)
<P>
The other two options were added later because the special nature of the
New flag was not what was wanted by all users.
New does match what you see in the index by default, but if you use
the IMAPSTATUS token in the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A>&quot; it may not
be exactly what you expect.
&quot;Unseen&quot; simply selects all unseen messages, whether or not
they are deleted or answered, and
&quot;Recent&quot; selects all of the messages which have been added to
the folder since you started this Pine session.
(That's not technically quite true. If there are multiple mail clients
reading an IMAP mailbox, each message will be marked as Recent in only
one of the client's sessions.
That behavior can be convenienent for some purposes, like filtering, but
it isn't usually what you expect when selecting.)

<H1>Apply Command</H1>

Apply
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F6<!--chtml else-->A<!--chtml endif-->)
is the second step of most aggregate operations.  Apply
becomes active any time there is a defined set of selected messages.  The
following commands can be applied to a selected message set: delete,
undelete, reply, forward,
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
<!--chtml else--> 
pipe,
<!--chtml endif-->
print, take address, save, export, bounce, and flag.

The behavior of some of these commands in an aggregate sense is not easy to
explain.  Try them out to see what they do.

Another action you might want to take on a set of selected messages is to
zoom in on them.  Like apply, zoom only becomes active when messages have
been selected.
ZoomMode
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F3<!--chtml else-->Z<!--chtml endif-->)
is a toggle command which allows you to
zoom-in (and only see the selected messages) and zoom-out (to see all
messages in the folder).  Neither apply nor zoom removes the markings which
define the selected set; you need to use a select command in order
to do that.

the folder is sorted by either Threads or OrderedSubject, and the
<A HREF="h_config_thread_disp_style">Threading-Display-Style</A>
is set to something other than &quot;none&quot;.
By default, this command collapses or expands the subthread which starts at
the currently highlighted message, if any.
If the subthread is already collapsed, then this command expands it.
If the subthread is expanded, then this command collapses it.
If there are no more messages below the current message in the
thread tree (that is, there are no replies to the current message) then
this command does nothing.

<P>
The behavior of this command is affected by the option
<A HREF="h_config_slash_coll_entire">&quot;Slash-Collapses-Entire-Thread&quot;</A>.
Normally, this command Collapses or Expands the subthread which
starts at the currently highlighted message.
If the above option is set, then this command Collapses or Expands the
entire current thread instead of just the subthread.
The current thread is simply the top-level thread which contains the
current message.

In Pine's generic configuration, messages are presented in the order in

with the &quot;<A HREF="h_config_sort_key">Sort-Key</A>&quot; option.
You can also re-sort the folder on demand with the sort
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F7<!--chtml else-->$<!--chtml endif-->)
command.
Your sorting options are:

<UL>

<P>
The Reverse option will toggle the order the index is currently
sorted by, but will not change the relative sort order.

<P>
Sorting a folder does not actually rearrange the way the folder is saved,
it just re-arranges how the messages are presented to you.  This means
that Pine has to do the work of sorting every time you change sort order.
Sometimes, especially with PC-Pine or with large folders, this could take
a while.

The WhereIs
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->W<!--chtml endif-->)
command lets you search the MESSAGE INDEX for a word.
It scans through whatever you see, usually the name of the author
and the Subject line.
WhereIs has special subcommands to let you find the beginning of the
index (Ctrl-Y -- first message)
or the end of the index (Ctrl-V -- last message).
<P>
Note that WhereIs only searches through the visible text on the screen.
For example, if only part of the Subject of a message is shown because it
is long, then only the visible portion of the Subject is searched.
Also note that WhereIs does not &quot;see&quot; the 
&quot;X&quot; in column one of Index entries for selected messages
so it can't be used to search for
selected messages (use &quot;Zoom&quot; instead).
<P>
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set&quot;</A>
is turned on,
WhereIs can also be used as a quick way to select messages which match the
string being searched for.
Instead of typing carriage return to search for the next match, type
Ctrl-X to select all matches.
Once again, this only selects matches which are (or would be if the right
index line was on the screen) visible.
Truncated From lines or Subjects will cause matches to be missed.
Although WhereIs is sometimes convenient for quick matching, the Select
command is usually more powerful and usually faster.

(<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Enable-Incoming-Folders&quot;</A>)
or it is a newsgroup, then Pine will try to find the next folder or
newsgroup which contains <EM>Recent</EM> messages and will ask you
if you want to open that folder.
This behavior may be modified by using the
<A HREF="h_config_tab_uses_unseen">&quot;Tab-Uses-Unseen-For-Next-Folder&quot;</A>
feature which causes Pine to look for Unseen messages instead of Recent
messages.
The NextNew command's behavior is also affected by the configuration features
<A HREF="h_config_auto_open_unread">&quot;Auto-Open-Next-Unread&quot;</A>,
and
<A HREF="h_config_tab_no_prompt">&quot;Continue-Tab-Without-Confirm&quot;</A>.

<H1>Flag Command</H1>

Flag
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->*<!--chtml endif-->)
is the command which allows users to manipulate the status flags which
appear on the left side of the MESSAGE INDEX screen.  The most common
use of this is to mark a message as important. This is something of a
note to yourself to get back to that message.  You may also use the
flag command to set (or unset) the flags which indicate that a message
is new, answered, or deleted.<P>

Provided the mail server supports it,
you may also manipulate user-defined keywords
for a message using the flag command.
These keywords will be available if you use the Flag Details screen.
They will be listed after the Important, New, Answered, and Deleted flags,
which are always present.
You may add new keywords by defining them in the <A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A> option in the Setup/Config screen.

The availability of the flag command is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_flag">&quot;Enable-Flag-Cmd&quot;</A>
feature in your Pine configuration. Also, it is possible that Flag could be
administratively disabled by your system manager; if it doesn't work,
please check with your local help desk before reporting a bug.
The behavior of the flag command may be modified by the
<A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_default">&quot;Enable-Flag-Screen-Implicitly&quot;</A> option or the
<A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_kw_shortcut">&quot;Enable-Flag-Screen-Keyword-Shortcut&quot;</A> option.

<TITLE>HdrMode Command</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>HdrMode Command</H1>

Every email message comes with some header lines that you normally
don't see (and don't want to see).
These include anywhere from 3-20 lines (or more) added by the
Internet mail transport system to record the route your message took,
for diagnostic purposes.
These are normally of no import and simply
add clutter, so Pine suppresses them in the MESSAGE TEXT display.
This also includes other non-standard headers the message may contain.
If you want to see these headers, there is a way to reveal them.
<P>

The Header Mode
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F9<!--chtml else-->H<!--chtml endif-->)
command is a toggle which controls Pine's handling of these header
lines.  Normally, full headers is &quot;off&quot; and you only see a
few lines about who a message is to and who it is from.  When you
press
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F9<!--chtml else-->H<!--chtml endif-->)
to turn full headers on, Pine will show you
the normal header lines as well as delivery headers, comment headers,
MIME headers, and any other headers present.
<P>

Several different Pine commands honor the header mode -- it affects how
messages are displayed, how they appear in forward and reply email, how
they are printed, how they are saved, and how they are exported.
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
<!--chtml else--> 
The pipe command is also affected.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>

The presence or absence of the Header Mode command is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_full_hdr">&quot;Enable-Full-Header-Cmd&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Pine configuration.

<P>
If you have also turned on the
<A HREF="h_config_quote_suppression">&quot;Quote Suppression&quot;</A>
option then the HdrMode command actually rotates through three states
instead of just two.
The first is the normal view with long quotes suppressed.
The second is the normal view but with the long quotes included.
The last enables the display of all headers in the message.
When using Export, Pipe, Print, Forward, or Reply the quotes are
never suppressed, so the first two states are identical.

<P>
The behavior of the Header Mode command may be altered slightly by
turning on the
<A HREF="h_config_quell_full_hdr_reset">&quot;Quell-Full-Header-Auto-Reset&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Pine configuration.
In particular, it will cause the Header Mode to be persistent when moving
from message to message instead of resetting to the default for each message.

With the Take Address
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F10<!--chtml else-->T<!--chtml endif-->)
command, you can extract email addresses from an
incoming message and save them in an address book.  This is an easy way
to add to your address book and avoid having to remember the email
addresses of the people who write to you.
<P>

If the message is just to you individually, then you will only need to
provide a nickname.  If the message contains more than one email address,
then you will see an address
selection screen which lets you choose the address you want to save into
your address book, or lets you choose several of them add to a
personal distribution list.
<P>

Once you've added an entry to your address book, you can use it from the
message composer by typing the nickname of the entry into one of the
header fields (for example, into the To: field), or you can use ^T from
the header field to select the entry from your address book.

The easiest way to select a file is probably with the &quot;^T&quot;

After returning from that subcommand you will still be allowed to
edit the name you have selected.
Alternatively, you may type in a file name.

In any case, you finish by typing a carriage return to accept the
file name that is displayed.
If you have turned on the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_tab_complete">&quot;Enable-Tab-Completion&quot;</A>
option you may use TAB to complete partially typed in names.
<P>
The message you are exporting appears to have some attachments.
If you wish to save <EM>all</EM> of the attachments at once,
type the &quot;^P&quot; &quot;AllParts&quot; command to turn on
saving of the attachments.
You may turn it back off by typing &quot;^P&quot; again, which will now
be labeled &quot;NoAllParts&quot; instead.
If you want to save the parts the command displayed should be
&quot;NoAllParts&quot;!
When you choose to save attachments like this, the attachments will be saved
in a newly created directory.
That directory will have the same name as the file name you choose here,
with the letters &quot;.d&quot; appended.
If that directory already exists, then the letters &quot;.d_1&quot; will
be tried, then &quot;.d_2&quot; and so on until a name that doesn't exist
is found.
For example, if you select the file name
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>filename</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to export the file to, then the directory used for the attachments will be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>filename.d</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or perhaps
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>filename.d_&lt;n&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The attachments will then be put into files inside that directory.
The names for the attachment files will be derived from the attachments
if possible.
This is done in the same way as the default values are derived if you
save them one at a time.
(The &quot;filename&quot; parameter from the Content-Disposition header
is the first choice. If that doesn't exist, the &quot;name&quot;
parameter from the Content-Type header is used.)
If a name for a particular attachment is not available, then the
part number of the attachment is used, with the characters &quot;part_&quot;
prepended.
An example of that would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>part_2.1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you want to save only some of the attachments or if you want more control
over the directory and filename where an attachment is saved you may
cancel out of this command and View the attachment list.
From there you can save each attachment individually.

You may cancel the Export operation by typing &quot;^C&quot; after exiting

Save
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->S<!--chtml endif-->)
and Export
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F12<!--chtml else-->E<!--chtml endif-->)
are the two alternatives Pine gives you to keep a copy of the message
you are reading. If you want to keep the message within Pine's email
world, use &quot;Save&quot;; if you want to use the message in another
program, use &quot;Export&quot;.
<P>

When you Save a message, it is put into an existing folder or into a new
folder in one of your existing folder collections.  The message stays in
email format and can be read by Pine again.  Pine may use a special format
for its mail folders -- never edit a Pine folder by hand or with any
program other than Pine.  The exact behavior of the Save command can be
configured with the
<A HREF="h_config_quote_all_froms">&quot;Save-Will-Quote-Leading-Froms&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_save_wont_delete">&quot;Save-Will-Not-Delete&quot;</A>,
and 
<A HREF="h_config_save_advances">&quot;Save-Will-Advance&quot;</A>
feature list settings.
The name of the folder offered as a default is controlled by the option
<A HREF="h_config_saved_msg_name_rule">&quot;Saved-Msg-Name-Rule&quot;</A>.
<P>

When you use Export, the message is placed in a plain text file in your
home directory 
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, in the present configuration of your system, is
 &quot;<!--#echo var="HOME_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->
or current working directory
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, at least for your current Pine &quot;session,&quot; 
is &quot;<!--#echo var="CURRENT_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->, depending on the
<A HREF="h_config_use_current_dir">&quot;Use-Current-Dir&quot;</A>
configuration setting.  In the normal case, only minimal
headers are exported with the message; however, if the full header mode 
(whose availability must be enabled  by setting the feature 
<A HREF="h_config_enable_full_hdr">&quot;Enable-Full-Header-Cmd&quot;</A>
in SETUP CONFIGURATION) is
toggled on, then complete headers are exported along with the message
text. (If you have any <A HREF="h_config_display_filters">Display-Filters</A>

lists need the bounce command to handle list traffic.
Bounce is not anonymous.
A ReSent-From header is added to the message so that the recipient may
tell that you Bounced it to them.

(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F12<!--chtml else-->F<!--chtml endif-->)
are your two alternatives for following up on the
message you are reading.  You would use reply if you want to get email
back to the author of the message and/or the other people who have
already seen it.  You use forward if you want somebody new to see the
message.
<P>

In the normal case, the only thing that you must supply when forwarding a
message is the name/email address of the new recipient.
Pine will include the text of the forwarded message.
Pine will also include any attachments to the message.
There is space above the forwarded text for you to include additional comments.
<P>

When replying, you usually have to answer some questions.
If the message is to multiple people and/or specified with a Reply-To: header,
then you will have to decide who should get the reply.
You also need to decide whether or not to include the previous
message in your reply.
Some of this is configurable.
Specifically, see the
<A HREF="h_config_include_header">&quot;Include-Header-In-Reply&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_auto_include_reply">&quot;Include-Text-In-Reply&quot;</A>,

and
<A HREF="h_config_auto_reply_to">&quot;Reply-Always-Uses-Reply-To&quot;</A>

 be deleted or
copied as a unit, by setting a mark at the start of the block (Ctrl-^) and
then moving the cursor to the end of the desired text block.  You can then
&quot;cut&quot; the block out 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F9&quot;,
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;Ctrl-K&quot;,
<!--chtml endif-->
move the cursor, and &quot;paste&quot; it
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F10&quot;,
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;Ctrl-U&quot;,
<!--chtml endif-->
in the new location.  Also, you can paste more than once, allowing you
to use this feature to copy a block of text.<P>

If you press 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F9&quot;
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;^K&quot;
<!--chtml endif-->
without having marked anything, Pine will delete
a single line.  If you delete a group of lines together, Pine keeps them
in the same buffer, so 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F10
<!--chtml else-->
^U
<!--chtml endif-->
will restore them as a block.  About
terminology:  Mark is shown as &quot;^^&quot;.  The first &quot;^&quot; means you should
hold down the &quot;Control&quot; key on your keyboard.  The second &quot;^&quot; means
&quot;type the character ^&quot;.

<H1>Justify Command</H1>

The Justify
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
(F4)
<!--chtml else-->
(^J) 
<!--chtml endif-->
command reformats the text in the paragraph the cursor is in.
Paragraphs are separated by one blank line or a line beginning with a space.
This is useful when you have been editing a paragraph and the lines become
uneven.  The text is left aligned or justified and the right is ragged.  If
the text is already justified as typed with auto-wrap, no justification will
be done.

<P>
When composing a reply containing included text, the justify command
will reformat text to the right of the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string">Reply-Indent-String</A>&quot;,
adding or removing indented lines as needed.  Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line, a line containing only the Reply-Indent-String, or a
line containing the indent string and one or more blank spaces.
Included text that was previously indented (or &quot;quoted&quot;) is
not preserved.

<H1>Pipe Command SubOptions</H1>

By default, when you use the Pipe command, the processed text of the
message is sent to the Unix command
you specify and the output is captured by Pine and shown to you.
There are some sub-commands which may be used to alter this behavior.
These are toggles which switch the behavior between two possibilities.
They can be combined in any way you wish.
<P>
By default, the prompt at the bottom of the screen looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe message 37 to :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
if you are piping more than one message.
<P>
The sub-command options are:
<DL>
   <DT>Shown Text or Raw Text</DT>
   <DD>This option toggles between sending the shown (processed) text
of the message to the Unix command, and sending the
raw (unprocessed) text of the message to the Unix command.
The default is to send the shown text.
The raw version of the message will contain all of the headers and any
MIME encoding that the message contains.
If you've selected the Raw Text then the prompt will have the additional word
&quot;RAW&quot; in it, like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe RAW messages to :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You can experiment with this option by piping to something simple like the
Unix &quot;cat&quot; command.
   </DD>
   <DT>Captured Output or Free Output</DT>
   <DD>This option toggles between having Pine capture the output of
the Unix pipe command for display, and not capturing it.
If the command you are piping to is a filter which will produce output
you want to view, then you want to capture that output
for display (the default).
If the Unix command doesn't produce output or handles the display itself,
then you want free output.
When you've selected the Free Output option the prompt will change to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to (uncaptured) :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
   </DD>
   <DT>No Delimiter or With Delimiter</DT>
   <DD>This option controls whether or not a Unix mailbox style delimiter
will come before the text of the message.
This is the delimiter used in the common Unix mailbox format.
It's the single line which begins with the five characters
&quot;From&quot; followed by a &lt;SPACE&gt; character.
You'll usually only want to include this if the Unix command requires
input in the format of a traditional Unix mailbox file.
When you've selected the With Delimiter option the prompt will change to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to (delimited) :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
   </DD>
   <DT>To Same Pipe or To Individual Pipes</DT>
   <DD>This option only shows up if you are running an aggregate
pipe command.
That is, the command was Apply Pipe, not just Pipe.
You have the option of piping all of the selected messages through a
single pipe to a single instance of the Unix command,
or piping each individual message through a separate pipe to separate
instances of the Unix command.
The default is that all of the output will go through a single pipe
to a single instance of the command.
You can try this option with a command like &quot;less&quot;, with Free
Output enabled.
When you've selected the Individual Pipes option the prompt will change to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pipe messages to (new pipe) :</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
   </DD>
</DL>

<P>
As mentioned earlier, the options can be combined in any way you wish.
You may leave them all off, turn them all on, or turn some of them on
and some of them off.
If you use the pipe command a second time in the same session the default
options will be what you used the last time.

<P> 
This is the name of the folder on the previously specified server.
By default the folder name is interpreted as defining a section of your personal
folder area.  This area and how you specify it are defined by the
server, if one is specified.

<P>
To define a folder outside the default area, prefix
the path with the namespace to use when interpreting the
given path.  If a namespace is specified, the folder name begins with the
sharp (#) character followed by the name of the namespace
and then the namespace's path-element-delimiter.  Aside from the
name's format, namespaces can also imply access rights, content
policy, audience, location, and, occasionally, access methods.

<P>
Each server exports its own set (possibly of size one) of 
namespaces.
For a more detailed explanation read about
<A HREF="h_folder_name_namespaces">Namespaces</A>.

<P>
To specify the default for INBOX on the server you can usually just enter
&quot;INBOX&quot;, and the server will understand the special meaning of
that word.

<TITLE>WHAT IS A MAIL DROP?</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>What is a Mail Drop?</H1>

In some situaions it may make sense to have your mail delivered to one
folder (the Mail Drop) and then when you want to read mail that has been
delivered to the Mail Drop folder Pine will move it to another
destination folder.
Often the Mail Drop will be a remote folder and messages will be moved from
there to a local destination folder.

<P>
One example where this might make sense is if the Mail Drop folder is accessible
only with the POP protocol.
You could designate your POP inbox as the Mail Drop folder and have Pine move
mail from there to a local (on the same machine Pine is running on)
destination folder, where you'll read it.

<P>
A Mail Drop may only be used as your Inbox or as an
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Incoming folder&quot;</A>.

<P>
There is no attempt to synchronize the contents of the destination folder
with the contents of the Mail Drop folder.
All that happens is that all of the messages in the Mail Drop folder are
copied to the destination folder and then they are deleted and expunged (if possible)
from the Mail Drop folder.
The next time a check for new mail is made, any messages in the Mail 
Drop folder are once again copied to the destination folder and deleted
and expunged from the Mail Drop folder.
(If the Mail Drop folder is a news group, then the messages can't be
expunged from the newsgroup. Instead, only Recent messages are copied from
the newsgroup to the destination folder.)

<P>
Configuration of a Mail Drop is a little different from configuration of
a folder which does not use a Mail Drop because you have to specify two
folder names instead of one.
The two folders may be any types of folders that Pine can normally use.
They don't have to be a remote folder and a local folder, that is
simply the most common usage.
When you use a Mail Drop folder Pine will periodically re-open the Mail
Drop to check for new mail.
The new-mail checks will happen at the frequency set with the
<A HREF="h_config_mailcheck">Mail-Check-Interval</A> option,
but with a minimum time
(<A HREF="h_config_maildropcheck">MailDrop-Check-Minimum</A>)
between checks.
Because of this minimum you may notice that new mail does not
appear promptly when you expect it.
The reason for this is to protect the server from over-zealous opening and
closing of the Mail Drop folder.
If the user initiates the check by typing ^L (Ctrl-L) or the Next command when at
the end of the folder index, then the check will happen, regardless of how
long it has been since the previous check.
<P>
If there is new mail, that mail will be copied to the destination folder
and then will be deleted from the Mail Drop.
Note that using a Mail Drop with a local destination folder does not make
sense if you read mail from more than one machine, because the mail is
downloaded to the destination folder (which is accessible from only one
machine) and deleted from the Mail Drop.
<P>
The feature <A HREF="h_config_maildrops_preserve_state">Maildrops-Preserve-State</A> modifies the operation of Mail Drops.

<P>
The actual syntax used by Pine for a folder that uses a Mail Drop is:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;MailDropFolder&gt;&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;DestinationFolder&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The brackets are not literal.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&lt;DELIM&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is a single character which does not appear in the MailDropFolder name.
If the name doesn't contain spaces then it can be a space character.
The two folder names are full technical
<A HREF="h_valid_folder_names">folder names</A>
as used by Pine.
Here are a couple examples to give you an idea what is being talked about:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move&nbsp;{popserver.example.com/pop3}inbox&nbsp;localfolder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move+{nntpserver.example.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine+local&nbsp;folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

A #move folder may only be used as an
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Incoming folder&quot;</A> or
an Inbox.
When you are in the FOLDER LIST of Incoming Message Folders (after turning
on the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Enable-Incoming-Folders&quot;</A>
option)
the Add command has a subcommand &quot;Use Mail Drop&quot;
which may be helpful for defining the folder in your Pine configuration.
The same is true when you edit the
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path">Inbox-Path</A>
option in Setup/Config.
Each of these configuration methods will also create the DestinationFolder
if it doesn't already exist.
If you are having problems, make sure the DestinationFolder exists.

a message and then want to postpone it again, use the normal postpone
(Ctrl-O) command in the composer.

If you exit this screen without selecting a message, the Compose command

<H1>Folder Collections Explained</H1>


Those of you with simple mail configurations will just see a list of all the
folders you have when choosing FOLDER LIST from Pine's MAIN MENU.  
The special folders for INBOX, sent mail and saved messages
will appear at the top of the list.  All others are in alphabetical order.
<P>
If you
or your system administrator have defined more than one collection or if
you have a collection (for newsgroups or email folders) defined on your 
system, then you will see the COLLECTION LIST screen first when choosing 
FOLDER LIST from Pine's MAIN MENU.  (This selection level is new in Pine 4.00; 
previous versions showed all folder 
collections on the FOLDER LIST screen, with a &quot;Select Here to See
Expanded List&quot; button to reveal the folders in them.)
<P>
<H2>Why have multiple folder collections?</H2>
<P>
For Pine users who only maintain email folders (and not too many) on one host, 
a single folder collection is probably sufficient.<P>

However, people who have more than one email account - for example, one 
at their university, and one with their personal Internet Service Provider - 
will have different sets of folders on different hosts, and they may want to
access them all from the same installation of Pine, rather than use different 
software and/or log into other hosts to manipulate messages in different 
accounts.  (If in doubt whether one of your email accounts can be accessed 
with Pine, contact the technical support people for that account.)  Even people
who have only one email account on one host, but have dozens or
hundreds of email folders, may want to arrange these folders together in a 
meaningful way.<BR>
That is where multiple collections come in.

<H2>Types of Collections</H2>
<DL>
<DT>INCOMING FOLDERS</DT>
<DD>&quot;Incoming Message Folders&quot; 
is a special collection typically used to supplement your single INBOX.  
All the folders here are meant to be ones that receive incoming messages, 
which you intend to check more or less frequently.  
You may have multiple folders like this because you or your systems 
administrator have set up an external program (because this is not a 
function of Pine!) to filter incoming 
email messages into different folders, based on certain criteria such as 
sender, recipient, or subject; or because you have multiple accounts and 
wish to check their INBOXes easily.  This collection is established by 
setting the 
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Enable-Incoming-Folders&quot;</A>
feature in the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen, which is accessed from the 
MAIN MENU.
</DD>

<DT>NEWS</DT>
<DD>You can also define a collection specifically for
newsgroups.  Pine does this for you implicitly when you 
<A HREF="h_config_nntp_server">define an NNTP Server</A>
in your Pine configuration.  The news collection appears last in the 
COLLECTION LIST (though you can shuffle it up in the order of presentation),
and Pine knows not to save messages there.
</DD>

<DT>DEFAULT COLLECTION</DT>
<DD>This is the default collection for your saved and sent messages folders.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2>Defining Collections</H2>
<P>
In the absence of any folder-collection definitions, Pine will assume a
single default folder collection.
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
<!--chtml else-->
If necessary, Pine will create the directory
&quot;mail&quot; in your Unix home directory 
to hold your folders.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>
You can use the 
<A HREF="h_collection_maint">Setup/collectionList screen</A>, called up from 
the MAIN MENU, to manage your collection list.

For selecting messages, it is likely that the Indexcolor rules and possibly
the Roles rules will be most useful.
The others are there also, in case you find a use for them.
<P>
In order for this to be useful for selecting messages, the nicknames of
the rules have to be different.
Pine actually just gets the nickname of the rule that you select and then
looks up that rule using the nickname.
So if there are duplicate nicknames, the first rule that has that
nickname will be used.

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>PATTERNS</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>PATTERNS</H1>
Patterns are used with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, and Other Rules.
Patterns are compared with a message to see if there is a match.
For Filtering, the messages being checked are all the messages in the
folder, one at a time.
For Index Line Coloring, each message that is visible on the screen is
checked for matches with the Index Coloring Patterns.
Roles are used with the Reply, Forward, and Compose commands.
For Reply, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being replied to;
for Forward, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being forwarded;
and for Compose, there is no message, so the parts of the Pattern which depend
on a message (everything other than Current Folder Type and the
Beginning of Month and Year)
are not used.
Only the Current Folder Type matters for Compose (plus the Beginning of
Month or Year, which you wouldn't usually use for a Role).
For Scoring, the message being scored is compared with all of the Score
Patterns, and the Score Values from the ones that match are added together to 
get the message's score.
For Other Rules, there is no message. Only the Current Folder Type is checked
for Other Rules.
<P>
Each Pattern has several possible parts, all of which are optional.
In order for there to be a match, <EM>ALL</EM> of the
<EM>defined</EM> parts of the Pattern must match the message.
If a part is not defined it is considered a match, but note that a filtering
Pattern must have at least one defined part or it will be ignored.
For example, if the To pattern is not defined it will be
displayed as
<P>
<CENTER>To pattern = &lt;No Value Set&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
That is considered a match because it is not defined.
This means that the Pattern with nothing defined is a match if the
Current Folder Type matches, but there is an exception which was mentioned
in the previous paragraph.
Because filtering is a potentially destructive action, filtering Patterns
with nothing other than Current Folder Type defined are ignored.
If you really want a filtering Pattern to match all messages (subject to
Current Folder Type) the best way to do it is to define a Score interval
which includes all possible scores.
This would be the score interval <SAMP>(-INF,INF)</SAMP>.
This can be used even if you haven't defined any rules to Set Scores.
<P>
There are six predefined header patterns called the To, From, Sender, Cc, News,
and Subject patterns.
Besides those six predefined header patterns, you may add
additional header patterns with header fieldnames of your choosing.
You add an extra header pattern by placing the cursor on one of the
patterns while in the role editor and using the &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command.
The Recip pattern is a header pattern which stands for Recipient (To OR Cc)
and the Partic pattern is a header pattern which stands for
Participant (From OR To OR Cc).
(Defining the Recip pattern does not have the same effect as defining both
the To and Cc patterns. Recip is To <EM>OR</EM> Cc, not To <EM>AND</EM> Cc.)
Similar to the header patterns are the AllText pattern and the BodyText pattern.
Instead of comparing this pattern's text against only the contents of
a particular header field, the text for the AllText pattern is compared
with text anywhere in the message's header or body, and the text for the
BodyText pattern is compared with text anywhere in the message's body.
<P>
Any of the header patterns, the AllText pattern, or the BodyText pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
That is, if the pattern matches then it is considered to NOT be a match, and
if it does not match it is considered to be a match.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
a pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!urgent&quot; into the Subject
pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 Subject pattern = !urgent
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 7 character sequence &quot;!urgent&quot;.
In order to match messages which do not have &quot;urgent&quot; in
their Subject field, first type the characters &quot;urgent&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the Subject pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should look like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! Subject pattern = urgent
</PRE>
<P>
The contents of each of these header patterns (or the AllText or BodyText patterns) may
be a complete email address, part of an address, or a random set of
characters to match against.
It may also be a list of such patterns, which means you
are looking for a match against the first pattern in the list <EM>OR</EM>
the second pattern <EM>OR</EM> the third and so on.
For example, a Subject pattern equal to
<P>
<PRE>
 Subject pattern = urgent
                   emergency
                   alert
</PRE>
<P>
would match all messages with a subject which contained at least one
of those words.
It would also match subjects containing the words &quot;alerts&quot; or
&quot;Urgently&quot;.
<P>
The same example with &quot;NOT&quot; turned on would be
<P>
<PRE>
 ! Subject pattern = urgent
                     emergency
                     alert
</PRE>
<P>
which would match all messages with a subject which did <EM>NOT</EM> contain any of
those words.
You can use the &quot;Add Value&quot; command to add new words to the list,
or you can enter them as a comma-separated list.
<P>
(It is not possible to specify two patterns which must <EM>BOTH</EM> be
present for a match.
It is only possible to specify that <EM>EITHER</EM> pattern1 <EM>OR</EM>
pattern2 must be present,
and that is exactly what using a list does.)
<P>
The &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; and the &quot;Score Interval&quot; are
also part of the Pattern, although the &quot;Score Interval&quot; is not used
when checking for matches for Scoring.
There are five similar settings which relate to the status of the message.
These settings rely on the message being New or not, Deleted or not,
Answered or not, Important or not, and Recent or not.
There are also some other miscellaneous settings.
The first is the Age of the message in days.
Another is the Size of the message, in bytes.
The third is a setting which detects whether or not the Subject of a
message contains raw 8-bit characters (unencoded characters with the most
significant bit set).
There is a setting which detects whether or not this is the first time
Pine has been run this month (doesn't depend on individual messages),
and another which detects whether or not this is the first time Pine has
been run this year.
Other parts of the Pattern detect whether or not the From address of a
message appears in your address book, whether or not certain keywords
are set for a message, and whether or not certain character sets are
used in a message.

<H2>Parts of a Pattern</H2>

<H3>Header patterns</H3>

A header pattern is simply text which is searched for in the corresponding
header field.
For example, if a Pattern has a From header pattern with the value
&quot;@company.com&quot;, then only messages which have a From header
which contains the text &quot;@company.com&quot; will be possible
matches.
Matches don't have to be exact.
For example, if the relevant field of a message contains the text
&quot;mailbox@domain&quot; somewhere
in it, then header patterns of &quot;box&quot;, or &quot;x@d&quot;, or
&quot;mailbox@domain&quot; are all matches.
<P>
All parts of the Pattern must match so, for example,
if a message matches a defined
From pattern, it still must be checked against the other parts of the
Pattern which have been defined.
The To header pattern is a slightly special case.
If the message being checked has a Resent-To header, the addresses
there are used in place of the addresses in the To header.
This is only true for the To header.
Resent-cc and Resent-From headers are never used unless you add them
with the eXtraHdrs command.
<P>
The meaning of a header pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
It would look something like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! From pattern = susan@example.com
</PRE>
<P>
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
<P>
If you want to check for the presence of a header field but don't care
about its value, then
the empty pattern which you get by entering a pair of
double quotes (&quot;&quot;) should match any message which
has the corresponding header field.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_alltext">AllText patterns</A></H3>

AllText patterns are just like header patterns except that the text is
searched for anywhere in the message's headers or body, not just in the
contents of a particular header field.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="pattern_bodytext">BodyText patterns</A></H3>

BodyText patterns are just like header patterns except that the text is
searched for anywhere in the message's body, not just in the
contents of a particular header field.
<P>

If there is more than one header pattern or AllText pattern or BodyText pattern
for which you want to take the
same action there is a shorthand notation which may be used.
Any of these patterns may be a list of patterns instead of
just a single pattern.
If any one of the patterns in the list matches the message
then it is considered a match.
For example, if &quot;company1&quot; and &quot;company2&quot; both required
you to use the same role when replying to messages, you might have
a To pattern which looks like
<P>
<PRE>
 To pattern = company1.com
              company2.com
</PRE>
<P>
This means that if the mail you are replying to was addressed to
either &quot;anything@company1.com&quot; or &quot;anything@company2.com&quot;,
then this Pattern is a match and the same actions will be taken.
<P>
The meaning of an AllText or BodyText pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple values
in any of the fields which may have multiple values (such as header patterns,
AllText patterns, BodyText patterns, keywords, folder lists, and so on),
you must escape comma with a
backslash (&#92;) if you want to include a literal comma in one of those fields.
In other words, if you type a backslash followed by a comma it will
be interpreted as a comma by Pine, instead of as a separator between
pattern values.
All other backslashes (those not followed by a comma) are literal
backslashes and should not be escaped.
It's unlikely you'll ever need to enter a literal comma or backslash in
any of the patterns.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_current_folder">Current Folder Type</A></H3>

The &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; may be set to one of four different
values: &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, or
&quot;Specific&quot;.
If the value is set to &quot;News&quot;, then the
Pattern will only match if the currently open folder is a newsgroup.
The value &quot;Email&quot; only matches if the current folder is not news and
the value &quot;Any&quot; causes any folder to match.
If the value of &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; is set to &quot;Specific&quot;,
then you must fill in a value for &quot;Folder&quot;, which is on the line
below the &quot;Specific&quot; line.
In this case you will only get a match if the currently open folder is
the specific folder you list.
You may give a list of folders instead of just a single
folder name, in which case the Pattern will match if the open folder is
any one of the folders in the list.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;,
the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are some samples of specific folder names:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.example.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>mail/local-folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder&quot; field is to use
the &quot;T&quot; command which is available when the &quot;Folder&quot; line is
highlighted, or to use the &quot;Take&quot; command with the configuration
feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_role_take">&quot;Enable-Rules-Under-Take&quot;</A>
turned on.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check whether
or not a Pattern matches a message.
For this reason, the default Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Email&quot;.
If you have Patterns with a Current Folder Type of either
&quot;Any&quot; or &quot;News&quot; and those Patterns are used for
Index Line Coloring or Scoring, you may experience
slower screen redrawing in the MESSAGE INDEX screen when in a newsgroup.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_age_interval">Age Interval</A></H3>

The &quot;Age Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
ages which should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Age Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_age,max_age)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_age&quot; and &quot;max_age&quot; are integers greater
than or equal to zero.
The special value &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the max value. It represents infinity.
<P>
Actually, this option may be defined as a list of intervals instead
of just a single interval.
The list is separated by commas.
It can look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_age1,max_age1),(min_age2,max_age2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is an Age Interval defined, it is a match if the age, in days, of
the message is contained in any of the intervals.
The intervals include both endpoints.
<P>
Even though this option is called Age, it isn't actually
the <EM>age</EM> of the message.
Instead, it is how many days ago the message arrived in one of your folders.
If the current time is a little past midnight, then a message that arrived
just before midnight arrived yesterday, even though the message is only
a few minutes old.
By default, the date being used is not the date in the Date
header of the message.
It is the date that the message arrived in one of your folders.
When you Save a message from one folder to another that arrival date
is preserved.
If you would like to use the date in the Date header that is possible.
Turn on the option
<A HREF="h_config_filt_opts_sentdate">&quot;Use-Date-Header-For-Age&quot;</A>
near the bottom of the rule definition.
A value of 0 is today, 1 is yesterday, 2 is the day before yesterday, and so on.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_size_interval">Size Interval</A></H3>

The &quot;Size Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
sizes which should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Size Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_size,max_size)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_size&quot; and &quot;max_size&quot; are integers greater
than or equal to zero.
The special value &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the max value. It represents infinity.
<P>
Actually, this option may be defined as a list of intervals instead
of just a single interval.
The list is separated by commas.
It can look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_size1,max_size1),(min_size2,max_size2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is a Size Interval defined, it is a match if the size, in bytes, of
the message is contained in any of the intervals.
The intervals include both endpoints.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_score_interval">Score Interval</A></H3>

The &quot;Score Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
scores which should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Score Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_score,max_score)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_score&quot; and &quot;max_score&quot; are positive or
negative integers, with min_score less than or equal to max_score.
The special values &quot;-INF&quot; and &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the min and max values to represent negative and positive infinity.
<P>
Actually, a list of intervals may be used if you wish.
A list would look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_score1,max_score1),(min_score2,max_score2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is a Score Interval defined, it is a match if the score for
the message is contained in any of the intervals in the list.
The intervals include the endpoints.
The score for a message is calculated by looking at every Score rule defined and
adding up the Score Values for the ones which match the message.
When deciding whether or not a Pattern matches a message for purposes of
calculating the score, the Score Interval is ignored.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_message_status">Message Status</A></H3>

There are five separate message status settings.
By default, all five are set to the value &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will match any message.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that the particular status must be true
for a match, and the value &quot;No&quot; means that the particular
status must not be true for a match.
For example, one of the five Message Status settings is whether a message
is marked Important or not.
A &quot;Yes&quot; means that the message must be Important to be
considered a match and &quot;No&quot; means that the message must not be
Important to be considered a match.
The same is true of the other four message status settings which depend
on whether or not the message is New; whether the message has 
been Answered or not; whether the message has been Deleted or not, and
whether the message is Recent or not. 
The nomenclature is a bit confusing.
New means that the message is Unseen.
It could have been in your mailbox for a long time but if you haven't looked
at it, it is still considered New.
That matches the default Pine index display which shows an N for such a
message.
Recent means that the message was added to this folder since the last time
you opened the folder.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_message_keywords">Message Keywords</A></H3>

Keywords are similar to Message Status, but they are chosen by the user.
Provided the mail server allows for it, you may add a set of possible keywords
to a folder and then you may set those keywords or not for each message
in the folder (see <A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag Command</A>).
The syntax of this part of the Pattern is similar to the header patterns.
It is a list of keywords.
The Keyword part of the Pattern is a match if the message has any of
the keywords in the list set.
Like other parts of the Pattern, if this is unset it will be ignored.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_message_charsets">Message Character Sets</A></H3>

A message may use one or more character sets.
This part of the Pattern matches messages that make use of one or more of
the character sets specified in the pattern.
It will be considered a match if a message uses any of the character
sets in the list you give here.

<P>
Besides actual character set names (for example, ISO-8859-7, KOI8-R, or
GB2312) you may also use some shorthand names that Pine provides.
These names are more understandable shorthand names for sets of 
character set names.
Two examples are &quot;Cyrillic&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot;.
Selecting one of these shorthand names is equivalent to selecting all of
the character sets that make up the set.
You can see all of these shorthand names and the lists of character sets
they stand for by typing the &quot;T&quot; command with the Character
Set pattern highlighted.
The syntax of this part of the Pattern is similar to the header patterns
and the Message Keywords pattern.
It is a list of character sets (or shorthand names).
The Character Set part of the Pattern is a match if the message uses any
of the character sets in the list.
Like other parts of the Pattern, if this is unset it will be ignored.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_8bit_subject">Raw 8-bit in Subject</A></H3>

It seems that lots of unwanted email contains unencoded 8-bit characters
in the Subject.
Normally, characters with the 8th bit set are not allowed in the Subject
header unless they are MIME-encoded.
This option gives you a way to match messages which have Subjects which
contain unencoded 8-bit characters.
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will match any message.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that there must be raw 8-bit characters in
the Subject of the message in order for there to be a match,
and the value &quot;No&quot; is the opposite.
Setting this option will affect performance in large folders because the
subject of each message in the folder has to be checked.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_bom">Beginning of Month</A></H3>

This option gives you a way to take some action once per month.
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will always match.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that this must be the first time Pine has
been run this month in order to count as a match,
and the value &quot;No&quot; is the opposite.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_boy">Beginning of Year</A></H3>

This option gives you a way to take some action once per year.
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will always match.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that this must be the first time Pine has
been run this year in order to count as a match,
and the value &quot;No&quot; is the opposite.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_abookfrom">From or Reply-To address in Address Books</A></H3>

This option gives you a way to match messages which have a From or
a Reply-To address
which is in one of your address books.
Only the simple entries in your address books are searched.
Address book distribution lists are ignored!
By default, the value of this option is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will match any message.
The value &quot;Yes, in any address book&quot; means either the From address
or the Reply-To address of the message must be in at least one of your
address books in order to be a match.
The value &quot;No, not in any address book&quot;
means neither the From nor the Reply-To addresses may
be in any of your address books in order to be a match.
The values &quot;Yes, in specific address books&quot; and
&quot;No, not in any of specific address books&quot; are similar but instead
of depending on all address books you are allowed to give a list of address
books to look in.
Setting this option will affect performance in large folders because the
From and Reply-To of each message in the folder have to be checked.

<H3><A NAME="pattern_categorizer">Categorizer Command</A></H3>

This is a command that is run with its standard input set to the message
being checked and its standard output discarded.
The full directory path should be specified.
The command will be run and then its exit status will be checked against
the Exit Status Interval, which defaults to just the value zero.
If the exit status of the command falls in the interval, it is considered
a match, otherwise it is not a match.
<P>

This option may actually be a list of commands.
The first one that exists and is executable is used.
That makes it possible to use the same configuration with Unix Pine and
PC-Pine.
<P>

If none of the commands in the list exists and is executable then the rule
is <EM>not</EM> a match.
If it is possible that the command may not exist, you should be careful
to structure your rules so that nothing destructive
happens when the command does not exist.
For example, you might have a filter that filters away spam when there is
a match but does nothing when there is not a match.
That would continue to work correctly if the command didn't exist.
However, if you have a filter which filters away spam when there is not
a match and keeps it when there is a match, that would filter everything
if the categorizer command didn't exist.
<P>
Here is an <A HREF="h_config_role_cat_cmd_example">example</A>
setup for the bogofilter filter.

<H2>Description of the Setup Roles Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of the rules
which determine the role you are playing when composing a message.
<P>
You may play different roles depending on who you are replying to.
For example, if you are replying to a message addressed to help-desk you
may be acting as a Help Desk Worker.
That role may require that you use a different return address and/or
a different signature.
<P>
Roles are optional.
If you set up roles they work like this:  Each role has a set of
&quot;Uses&quot;, which indicate whether or not a role is eligible to be
considered for a particular use; a &quot;Pattern&quot;,
which is used to decide which of the eligible roles is used; and a set
of &quot;Actions&quot;, which are taken when that role is used.
When you reply to a message, the message you are replying to is compared
with the Patterns of the roles marked as eligible for use when replying.
The comparisons start with the first eligible role and keep going until there
is a match.
If a match is found, the matching role's Actions are taken.

<H2>Role Uses</H2>

There are three types of use to be configured;
one for Replying, one for Forwarding, and one for Composing.
These indicate whether or not you want a role to be considered when you
type the Reply, Forward, or Compose commands.
(The Role command is an alternate form of the Compose command, and it is
not affected by these settings.)
Each of these Use types has three possible values.
The value &quot;Never&quot;
means that the role will never be considered as a candidate for use with
the corresponding command.
For example, if you set a role's Reply Use to Never, then when you Reply to
a message, that role won't even be considered.
(That isn't quite true. If the message you are replying to matches some other
role which requires confirmation,
then there will be a ^T command available which allows you to select a role
from all of your roles, not just the reply-eligible roles.)
<P>

The options &quot;With confirmation&quot; and &quot;Without confirmation&quot;
both mean that you do want to consider this role when using the corresponding
command.
For either of these settings the role's Pattern will
be checked to see if it matches the message.
For Reply Use, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being replied to.
For Forward Use, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being forwarded.
For Compose Use, there is no message, so the parts of the Pattern which depend
on a message (everything other than Current Folder Type) are ignored.
In all cases, the Current Folder Type is checked if defined.
If there is a match then this role will either be used without confirmation
or will be the default when confirmation is asked for, depending on
which of the two options is selected.
If confirmation is requested, you will have a chance to
choose No Role instead of the offered role, or to
change the role to any one of your other roles (with the ^T command).

<H2>Role Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a role the message is
compared with the Role's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, and Other Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.
<P>
Since header patterns, AllText patterns, and BodyText patterns which are unset are ignored,
a role which has all header patterns unset, the AllText pattern unset,
the BodyText pattern unset,
the Score Interval unset, and the Current Folder Type set to
&quot;Any&quot; may be used as a default role.
It should be put last in the list of roles since the matching
starts at the beginning and proceeds until one of the roles is a match.
If no roles at all match, then Pine will
use its regular methods of defining the role.
If you wanted to, you could define a different &quot;default&quot; role
for Replying, Forwarding, and Composing by setting the
&quot;Use&quot; fields appropriately.

<H2>Role Actions</H2>

Once a role match is found, the role's Actions are taken.
For each role there are several possible actions that may be defined.
They are actions to set the From address, the Reply-To address,
the Fcc, the Signature, the Template file, and Other Headers.

<H3>Set From</H3>

The From address is the address used on the From line of the message
you are sending.

<H3>Set Reply-To</H3>

The Reply-To address is the address used on the Reply-To line of the message
you are sending.
You don't need a Reply-To address unless it is different from the From address.

<H3>Set Other Headers</H3>

If you want to set the value of the From or Reply-To headers, use
the specific fields &quot;Set From&quot; or &quot;Set Reply-To&quot;.
If you want to set the values of other headers, use this field.
This field is similar to the
<A HREF="h_config_custom_hdrs">Customized-Hdrs</A> configuration option.
Each header you specify here must include the header tag
(&quot;To:&quot;, &quot;Approved:&quot;, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.
It is different from the Customized-Hdrs in that the value you give
for a header here will replace any value that already exists.
For example, if you are Replying to a message there will be at least one
address in the To header (the address you are Replying to).
However, if you Reply using a role which sets the To header, that role's
To header value will be used instead.

<H3>Set Fcc</H3>

The Fcc is used as the Fcc for the message you are sending.

<H3>Set Signature or Set LiteralSig</H3>

The Signature is the name of a file to be used as the signature file when
this role is being used.
If the name of the file has a vertical bar following it (|)
then it is assumed that the file is a program that should be run to
produce the signature.
If the LiteralSig is set, then it is used instead of the signature file.
LiteralSig is just a different way to store the signature.
It is stored in the pine configuration file instead of in a separate
signature file.
If the <A HREF="h_config_literal_sig">Literal-Signature</A> option is defined
either in the role or as the default signature in the Setup/Config screen,
then the signature file is ignored.

<H3>Set Template</H3>

A Template is the name of a file to be included in the message when this
role is being used.
If the name of the file has a vertical bar following it (|)
then it is assumed that the file is a program that should be run to
produce the template.

<P>
Both signature files and template files may be stored remotely on an IMAP
server.
In order to do that you just give the file a remote name.
This works just like the regular
<A HREF="h_config_signature_file">Signature-File</A>
option which is configured from the Setup/Configuration screen.
A remote signature file name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/sig3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Once you have named the remote signature or template file you create its
contents by using the &quot;F&quot; &quot;editFile&quot; command when the
cursor is on the &quot;Set Signature&quot; or &quot;Set Template&quot;
line of the role editor.

<P>
Both signature files and template files (or the output of signature programs
and template file programs) may contain special tokens
which are replaced with contents
which depend on the message being replied to or forwarded.
See the help for the individual fields inside the role editor for more
information on tokens.

<H3>Use SMTP Server</H3>

If this field has a value, then it will be used as the SMTP server
to send mail when this role is being used (unless the SMTP server variable
is set in the system-wide fixed configuration file).
It has the same semantics as the
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;SMTP-Server&quot;</A>
variable in the Setup/Config screen.
When you postpone the composition this SMTP server list will be saved
with the postponed composition and it cannot be changed later.
Because of that, you may want to make this a list of SMTP servers
with the preferred server at the front of the list and alternate servers
later in the list.

<P>
If any of the actions are left unset, then the action depends on what
is present in the &quot;Initialize settings using role&quot; field.
If you've listed the nickname of another one of your roles there, then the
corresponding action from that role will be used here.
If that action is also blank, or if there is no nickname specified,
then Pine will do whatever it normally does to set these actions.
This depends on other configuration options and features you've set.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new role definition to your set of
roles.
The new role will be added after the highlighted role.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted role.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Uses, Pattern,
and Actions of the currently highlighted role.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the roles.
You may move the currently highlighted role up or down in the list.
The order of the roles is important since the roles are tested for a
match starting with the first role and continuing until a match is found.
You should place the roles with more specific Patterns near the beginning
of the list, and those with more general Patterns near the end so that
the more specific matches will happen when appropriate.

<H3>Replicate</H3>

The Replicate command is used to copy an existing role and modify it.
The new role will be added after the highlighted role.

<H3>IncludeFile</H3>

The IncludeFile command allows you to add a roles file to your configuration.
Usually, your roles will be contained in your Pine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your roles may be stored in a separate file.
If a roles file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Pine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted role.
You may also insert an empty file or a file which does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty roles file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move roles into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial role into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a roles file from your roles configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a roles file
that file must have at least one role
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy role to the file in order to exclude the file.

<H2>Description of the Setup Other Rules Screen</H2>

This is where you may set various actions which do not fit well into the
other Rules categories.

<H2>Patterns</H2>

Other Rules are a little different from the rest of the Rules because
they depend only on the current folder, and not on a particular message.
In order to determine whether or not a rule's actions should be applied
the current folder is compared with the rule's Pattern, which consists
of only the Current Folder Type.
Current Folder Type works the same for Other Rules as it does for Roles,
Filtering, Index Coloring, and Scoring.
Keep in mind that the only part of the Pattern which applies to Other
Rules is the Current Folder Type when looking at the description of
Patterns given
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.

<H2>The Actions</H2>

<H3>Set Sort Order</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set a sort order which is different from your default sort order.
The default is set in the Setup/Config screen with
the &quot;<A HREF="h_config_sort_key">Sort-Key</A>&quot; option.
If the Sort Order action is set, then the folder will be displayed sorted in
that sort order instead of in the default order.
<P>
A possible point of confusion arises when you change the configuration
of the Sort Order for the currently open folder.
The folder will normally be re-sorted when you go back to viewing the
index.
However, if you have manually sorted the folder with the
Sort
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F7<!--chtml else-->$<!--chtml endif-->)
command, then it will not be re-sorted until the next time it is opened.

<H3>Set Index Format</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set an Index Format which is different from your default Index Format,
which is set with the
<A HREF="h_config_index_format">&quot;Index-Format&quot;</A> option.
If so, the index will be displayed with this format instead of the default.

<H3>Set Startup Rule</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set a startup rule which is different from the default startup rule.
The default for incoming folders is set in the Setup/Config screen with
the &quot;Incoming-Startup-Rule&quot; option.
The default for folders other than INBOX that are not part of your
incoming collection
(see <A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">Enable-Incoming-Folders</A> feature) 
is to start with the last message in the folder.
If the Startup Rule is set to something other than &quot;default&quot;,
then the rule will determine which message will be the current message when
the folder is first opened.
<P>
The various startup rule possibilities work the same here as they do in
the incoming collection, so check
<A HREF="h_config_inc_startup">Incoming-Startup-Rule</A>
for more help.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new rule definition to your set of
rules.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted rule.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Pattern,
and Action of the currently highlighted rule.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the rules.
You may move the currently highlighted rule up or down in the list.
The order of the rules is important since the rules are tested for a
match starting with the first rule and continuing until a match is found.
You should place the rules with more specific Patterns near the beginning
of the list, and those with more general Patterns near the end so that
the more specific matches will happen when appropriate.

<H3>Replicate</H3>

The Replicate command is used to copy an existing rule definition and modify it.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>IncludeFile</H3>

The IncludeFile command allows you to add a rules file to your configuration.
Usually, your rules will be contained in your Pine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your rules may be stored in a separate file.
If a rules file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Pine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted rule.
You may also insert an empty file or a file which does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty rules file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move rules into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial rule into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a rules file from your rules configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a rules file
that file must have at least one rule
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy rule to the file in order to exclude the file.

<H2>Description of the Setup Index Line Colors Screen</H2>

Index Line Color causes lines in the MESSAGE INDEX screen to be colored.
This action is only available if your terminal is capable of displaying
color and color display has been enabled with the
<A HREF="h_config_color_style">Color-Style</A> option within the
Setup Color screen.
(In PC-Pine, color is always enabled so there is no option to turn on.)
This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of the rules
which cause the lines in the MESSAGE INDEX to be displayed in different
colors.
<P>
Each rule has a &quot;Pattern&quot;,
which is used to decide which of the rules is used; and the color which
is used if the Pattern matches a particular message.

<H2>Index Color Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches an Index Color Rule
the message is compared with the rule's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, and Other Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.

<P>
If none of the Index Color rules is a match for a particular index line,
then the color used is set using
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.

<H2>Index Line Color</H2>

This is the color that index lines are colored when there is a matching
Pattern.
This colors the whole index line, except possibly the status letters
which may be colored separately using
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new rule definition to your set of

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the rules.
You may move the currently highlighted rule up or down in the list.
The order of the rules is important since the rules are tested for a

<H2>Description of the Setup Filtering Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of the rules
which determine the filtering Pine does on folders you view.
<P>
The software which actually delivers mail (the stuff that happens
before Pine is involved) for you is in a better position to do mail filtering
than Pine itself.
If possible, you may want to look into using that sort of mail filtering to
deliver mail to different folders, delete it, or forward it.
However, if you'd like Pine to help with this, Pine's filtering is for you.
<P>
Filtering is a way to automatically move certain messages from one folder
to another or to delete messages.
It can also be used to set message status bits (Important, Deleted, New,
Answered).
Pine doesn't have the ability to forward mail to another address.
<P>
Each filtering rule has a &quot;Pattern&quot; and a &quot;Filter Action&quot;.
When a folder is opened, when new mail arrives in an open folder, or
when mail is Expunged from a folder; each
message is compared with the Patterns of your filtering rules.
The comparisons start with the first rule and keep going until there
is a match.
If a match is found, the message may be deleted or moved, depending on
the setting of the Filter Action.
If the message is not deleted, it may have its status altered.

<P>
<EM>NOTE:</EM>
When setting up a Pattern used to delete messages,
it is recommended that you test the Pattern first with a &quot;Move&quot;
folder specified in
case unintended matches occur.  Messages that are deleted will be removed 
from the folder and <EM>unrecoverable</EM> from within Pine after the
next Expunge command or once the folder being filtered has been closed.

<H2>Filter Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a filter the message is
compared with the Filter's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, and Other Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.
<P>
Since filtering is a potentially destructive action, if you have a filtering
Pattern with nothing other than Current Folder Type set, that filtering
rule is ignored.

<H2>Filter Actions</H2>

Once a filter match is found for a particular message, there are some actions
which may be taken.
First, the message may have its status changed.
This is the same message status that you can manipulate manually using the
<a href="h_common_flag">Flag Command</a>.
There are always four elements of message status that you can control.
You can set or clear the Important status, the New status, the Deleted
status, and the Answered status.
Of course, if the filter is going to delete the message,
then there is no point in setting message status.
You may also be able to set user-defined keywords for a message.
Read a little about keywords in the help text for the
<A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag</A> command.
<P>
Second, the filter may delete or move the message.
Deleting the message marks it Deleted and removes it from view.
It is effectively gone forever (though it technically is still there until
the next expunge command, which may happen implicitly).
Moving the message moves it from the open folder into the folder
listed on the &quot;Folder List&quot; line of the filter configuration.
If you list more than one folder name (separated by commas) then the message
will be copied to each of those folders.
In any case, if &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Move&quot; is set then the
message is removed from the current folder.
If you just want to set the messages status without deleting it from
the folder, then set the filter action to
&quot;Just Set Message Status&quot;.
<P>
(There is no way to do a Copy instead of a Move, due to the difficulties
involved in keeping track of whether or not a message has
already been copied.)

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new filter definition to your set of
filters.
The new filter will be added after the highlighted filter.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted filter.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Pattern,

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the filters.
You may move the currently highlighted filter up or down in the list.
The order of the filters is important since the filters are tested for a

You should place the filters with more specific Patterns near the beginning

Usually, your filters will be contained in your Pine configuration file.
If you wish, some or all of your filters may be stored in a separate file.
If a filters file already exists (maybe it was made by somebody else using
Pine), you may insert it before the currently highlighted filter.
You may also insert an empty file or a file which does not yet exist.
Once you have an empty filters file in your configuration, you may use
the Shuffle command to move filters into it.
In fact, that's the only way to get the initial filter into the file.

<H3>eXcludeFile</H3>

The eXcludeFile command removes a filters file from your filters configuration.
A limitation of the program is that in order to exclude a filters file
that file must have at least one filter
in it, otherwise you won't be able to highlight a line in the file.
So you may have to add a dummy filter to the file in order to exclude the file.

<H2>Description of the Setup Scoring Screen</H2>

Most people will not use scores at all, but if you do use them, here's how
they work in Pine.
Using this screen, you may define Scoring rules.
The score for a message is calculated by looking at every Score rule defined
and adding up the Score Values for the ones which match the message.
If there are no matches for a message, it has a score of zero.
Message scores may be used a couple of ways in Pine.

<H3>Sorting by Score</H3>

One of the methods you may use to sort message indexes is to sort by
score.
The scores of all the messages in a folder will be calculated and then
the index will be ordered by placing the messages in order of ascending or
descending score.

<H3>Scores for use in Patterns</H3>

The Patterns used for Roles, Index Line Coloring, and Filtering have a
category labeled &quot;Score Interval&quot;.
When a message is being compared with a Pattern to check for a match, if
the Score Interval is set only messages which have a score somewhere in
the interval are a match.

<H2>Scoring Rule Patterns</H2>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a scoring rule
the message is compared with the rule's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, and Other Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="h_rule_patterns">here</A>&quot;.

<P>
Actually, Scoring rule Patterns are slightly different from the other types of
Patterns because Scoring rule Patterns don't contain a Score Interval.
In other words, when calculating the score for a message, which is done
by looking at the Scoring rule Patterns, scores aren't used.

<H2>Score Value</H2>

This is the value that will be added to the score for a message if the
rule's Pattern is a match.
Each individual Score Value is an integer between -100 and 100, and the
values from matching rules are added together to get a message's score.

<H2>Command Descriptions</H2>

<H3>Add</H3>

The Add command is used to add a new scoring rule definition.
The new rule will be added after the highlighted rule.

<H3>Delete</H3>

The Delete command deletes the currently highlighted scoring rule.

<H3>Change</H3>

The Change command lets you edit the nickname, Pattern,
and Score Value of the currently highlighted scoring rule.

<H3>Shuffle</H3>

The Shuffle command allows you to change the order of the scoring rules.
You may move the currently highlighted rule up or down in the list.
The order of the rules is important since the rules are tested for a
match starting with the first rule and continuing until a match is found.
You should place the rules with more specific Patterns near the beginning
of the list, and those with more general Patterns near the end so that
the more specific matches will happen when appropriate.

<H2>Description of the Setup LDAP Directory Servers Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of your
directory servers. You may also set some optional behavior for each server.
The &quot;Add Dir&quot; command brings up a blank form to 
fill in. You will have to supply at least the name of the LDAP server.
You will often have to supply a search base to be used with that server,
as well. Once the form has been brought up on your screen, there is help
available for each of the options you may set.
<P>
The &quot;Del Dir&quot; command allows you to remove a directory server
from your configuration.
<P>
The &quot;Change&quot; command is similar to the &quot;Add Dir&quot; command.
The difference is that instead of bringing up a form for a new server
configuration, you are changing the configuration of an existing entry.
For example, you might want to correct a typing error, change a
nickname, or change one of the options set for that server.
<P>
The &quot;Shuffle&quot; command is used to change the order of directory
servers.

Export might be a reasonable way to store a backup or an archival copy of
a folder.
The exported-to file is a local file on the system where you are running Pine.
The &quot;Import&quot; command is the opposite of the Export command.
It reads a file created by Export and asks where it should save it in your
folders.
This could be a new folder or an existing folder.
If the folder already exists, the messages from the exported file will be
appended to the folder.
<P>
<CENTER>Description of the FOLDER LIST Screen</CENTER>

The purpose of the FOLDER LIST screen is to help you browse and manage
the folders and directories (also known as &quot;hierarchy&quot;)
contained within a collection.

<P>
Folders and directories are arranged alphabetically across lines of
the screen.  Directories, if present, are denoted by a special
character at the end of the name known as the hierarchy delimiter
(typically, &quot;/&quot;).  By default, folders and directories are
mixed together.  The
"<A HREF="h_config_fld_sort_rule">Folder-Sort-Rule</A>"
configuration option can be used to group directories toward the 
beginning or end of the list.

<P>
The Next/Prev Page commands help browse the list, the Next/Prev Fldr
commands change the &quot;selected&quot; (i.e., highlighted) folder or
directory, and the View Fldr/Dir commands will &quot;open&quot; the
selected item.  Folder and directory management is provided via the
Rename, Delete and Add commands.

<P><CENTER>About Folders</CENTER>
What are Folders?<P>

Folders are simply files where messages are kept.  Every message has to be
in a folder.  Most every Pine user starts out with 3 folders: an INBOX, a
folder for sent mail and a folder for saved messages.<P>

You may create as many other folders as you wish.  They must be given
names that can be filenames on the filesystem.  
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
Normally PC-Pine folders are
automatically given the filename extension &quot;.MTX&quot; (which stands
for Mailbox-text).  The extension is suppressed from FOLDER LIST
displays, and should not be entered when typing a folder name at a
Save or Goto prompt.  The use of the MTX extension can be overridden
by the Setup/Configuration option 
<A HREF="h_config_folder_extension">Folder-Extension</A>, 
which may be useful when accessing
saved-message folders on a Unix host via SMB or NFS.  PC-Pine can
understand the normal Unix mail folder format, but can only open those
folders READ-ONLY.
<!--chtml else-->
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>

You can move messages from one folder to another by opening the original
folder and saving messages into the other folder just as you can save
message from your INBOX to any other folder.<P>

Folders are typically just files in the filesystem.  However, the files
which are
folders have some special formatting in them (so that Pine knows where one
message ends and another begins) and should <EM>not</EM> be edited outside of
Pine.  If you want copies of your messages in text files that you can edit
or otherwise manipulate, use the Export command to copy them from Pine into
your regular file area.

<P>
FOR MORE INFORMATION: See the section on
<A HREF="h_valid_folder_names">Valid Folder Names</A>.
<P>
<CENTER>About Directories</CENTER>
<P>
A directory is simply a container used to group folders within a
folder list.  You can create as many directories as you like.  And 
directories can even contain directories themselves.

<P>
SPECIAL NOTES: When accessing folders on an IMAP server, it is important
to note that not all IMAP servers support directories.  If you find that
the Add command fails to offer the &quot;Create Directory&quot; subcommand,
then it's likely that directories are not supported by the server serving
in that collection.

<P>
Similarly, servers that do provide for directories may not do so in
the same way.  On some servers, for example, each folder name you
create is at the same time capable of being a directory.  When this
happens, Pine will display both the folder name and the name of the
directory (with trailing hierarchy delimiter) in the folder list.

<P>
Another issue with IMAP access, though with a much smaller set of servers,
is that not all servers accept the request to list out the available
folders and directories in the same way.  If you find yourself having
trouble viewing folders on your server, you might investigate the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_lame_list_mode">Enable-Lame-List-Mode</A>&quot;
feature.

<TITLE>Explanation of Valid Folder Names</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>Folder Name Syntax Explained</H1>

Once your folder collections are defined, you can usually refer to
folders by their simple (unqualified) name, or pick from a FOLDER LIST
display.  However, understanding the complete syntax for folder names,
both local and remote, is handy when using the Goto command and when
you are adding new folder collections via the Setups/collectionList screen.
<P>
A Pine folder name looks like

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[{&lt;remote-specification&gt;}][#&lt;namespace&gt;]&lt;namespace-specific-part&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The square brackets ([]) mean that the part is optional.

<P>
If there is no remote-specification, then the folder name is interpreted
locally on the computer running Pine.
Local folder names depend on the operating system used by the computer 
running Pine, as well as the configuration of that system.  For example,
&quot;C:&#92;PINE&#92;FOLDERS&#92;OCT-94&quot; might exist on a PC, and
&quot;~/mail/september-1994&quot; might be a reasonable folder name on a
system running Unix.

<P>
Pine users have the option of using folders which are stored on some other
computer.  Pine accesses remote folders via IMAP (the Internet Message
Access Protocol), or in the case of news, via NNTP (the Network News
Transport Protocol).  To be able to access remote folders in Pine, the
remote host must be running the appropriate server software (imapd or
nntpd) and you must correctly specify the name of the folder to Pine,
including the domain name of the remote machine. For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;monet.art.example.com}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
could be a remote folder specification, and so could
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;unixhost.art.example.com}~/mail/september-1994</SAMP></CENTER>
and
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;winhost.art.example.com}&#92;mymail&#92;SEP-94</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Note that in the case of remote folders, the directory/file path in the specification is 
determined by the operating system of the remote computer, <B>not</B> by
the operating system of the computer on which you are running Pine.
<P>
As you can tell, the name of the computer is in &#123;} brackets
followed immediately by the name of the folder.  (In each of these cases the
optional namespace is missing.)  If, as in these
examples, there is no remote access protocol specified, then IMAP is
assumed.  Check
<A HREF="h_folder_server_syntax">here</A>
for a more detailed look at what options can be placed between the brackets.
If there are no brackets at all, then the folder name is interpreted locally
on the computer on which you are running Pine.

<P>
To the right of the brackets when a server name is present, or at the
start of the foldername if no server is present, the sharp sign,
&quot;#&quot;, holds special meaning.  It indicates a folder name
outside the area reserved for your personal folders.  In fact, it's
used to indicate both the name of the folder, and a special phrase
telling Pine how to interpret the name that follows.

<P>
So, for example, Pine can be used to access a newsgroup that might be 
available on your computer using:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The sharp sign indicates the folder name is outside your personal
folder area.  The &quot;news.&quot; phrase after it tells Pine to 
interpret the remainder of the name as a newsgroup.

<P>
Similarly, to access a newsgroup on your IMAP server, you might
use something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#123;wharhol.art.example.com}#news.comp.mail.misc</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
There are a number of such special phrases (or &quot;namespaces&quot;)
available.  For a more detailed explanation read about
<A HREF="h_folder_name_namespaces">Namespaces</A>.

<P>
Note that &quot;INBOX&quot; has special meaning in both local and remote folder
names.  The name INBOX refers to your &quot;principal incoming
message folder&quot; and will be mapped to the actual file name used for your
INBOX on any given host.  Therefore, a name like
&quot;&#123;xxx.art.example.com}INBOX&quot; refers to whatever file is used to
store incoming mail for you on that particular host.

<TITLE>FOLDER NAME NAMESPACES EXPLAINED</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>Folder Name Namespaces Explained</H1>

A Pine folder name looks like

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[{&lt;remote-specification&gt;}][#&lt;namespace&gt;][&lt;namespace-specific-part&gt;]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The local part of a folder name has an optional &quot;Namespace&quot; which
tells Pine how to interpret the rest of the name.

<P> 
By default the folder name is interpreted as defining a section of your personal
folder area.  This area and how you specify it are defined by the
server, if one is specified, or, typically, the home
directory, if no server is defined.

<P>
If a namespace is specified, it begins with the
sharp, &quot;#&quot;, character followed by the name of the namespace
and then the namespace's path-element-delimiter.  Aside from the
path's format, namespaces can also imply access rights, content
policy, audience, location, and, occasionally, access methods.

<P>
Each server exports its own set (possibly of size one) of 
namespaces.  Hence, it's likely communication with your server's
administrator will be required for specific configurations.  Some of
the more common namespaces, however, include:

<DL>
<DT>#news.</DT>
<DD>This specifies a set of folders in the newsgroup namespace.  Newsgroup
names are hierarchically defined with each level delimited by a period.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>
<DT>#public/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the server may export to the general
public.
</DD>
<DT>#shared/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the server may export to groups
of users.
</DD>
<DT>#ftp/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that is the same as that it may have 
exported via the &quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;.
</DD>
<DT>#mh/</DT>
<DD>This specifies the personal folder area associated with folders
and directories that were created using the MH message handling system.
</DD>
<DT>#move/</DT>
<DD>This namespace is interpreted locally by Pine. It has an unusual interpretation and format.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;MailDropFolder&gt;&lt;DELIM&gt;&lt;DestinationFolder&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The #move namespace is followed by two folder names separated by a delimiter
character.
The delimiter character may be any character which does not appear in
the MailDropFolder name.
The meaning of #move is that mail will be copied from the MailDropFolder to
the DestinationFolder and then deleted (if possible) from the MailDropFolder.
Periodic checks at frequency
<A HREF="h_config_mailcheck">Mail-Check-Interval</A>, but with a minimum
time between checks set by
<A HREF="h_config_maildropcheck">MailDrop-Check-Minimum</A>,
are made for new mail arriving in the MailDropFolder.
An example which copies mail from a POP inbox to a local folder follows
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>#move+{popserver.example.com/pop3/ssl}inbox+local folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
To you it appears that mail is being delivered to the local folder when it
is copied from the MailDropFolder, and you read mail from the local folder.
<P>
Note that if the DestinationFolder does not exist then the messages are not
copied from the MailDropFolder.
A #move folder may only be used as an
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Incoming folder&quot;</A> or
an Inbox.
When you are in the FOLDER LIST of Incoming Message Folders (after turning
on the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_incoming">&quot;Enable-Incoming-Folders&quot;</A>
option)
the Add command has a subcommand &quot;Use Mail Drop&quot;
which may be helpful for defining the folder in your Pine configuration.
The same is true when you edit the
<A HREF="h_config_inbox_path">Inbox-Path</A>
option in Setup/Config.
Each of these configuration methods will also create the DestinationFolder
if it doesn't already exist.
If you are having problems, make sure the DestinationFolder exists.
You may find some more useful information about Mail Drops at
<A HREF="h_maildrop">What is a Mail Drop?</A>.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>

In addition, the server may support access to other user's folders,
provided you have suitable permissions.  Common methods use a prefix
of either &quot;~<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot;, or &quot;/<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot; to
indicate the root of the other user's folder area.

<P>
No, nothing's simple.

This screen is designed to help you subscribe to newsgroups you are
not currently subscribed to.  The screen display is a list of all
available newsgroups (or possibly a partial list if you specified a
partial name when entering the screen).  Groups you have already
subscribed to have the letters &quot;SUB&quot; next to them.  You may
select a single new group to subscribe to by moving the cursor to that
group and pressing &quot;S&quot; or carriage return.  Alternatively,
you may change into ListMode with the &quot;ListMode&quot; command.
The display will change slightly so that each group has a checkbox in
front of it.  Use the cursor and the Set/Unset command to place an
&quot;X&quot; in front of each newsgroup you wish to subscribe to.
<P>

When you are finished marking groups, the &quot;Subscribe&quot;
command will subscribe you to those groups you have marked.  Note, you
may not unsubscribe to groups with this command.  Instead of the
&quot;A&quot; &quot;Subscribe&quot; command, use the &quot;D&quot;
UnSbscrbe command.

<H2>Description of the Setup Address Books Screen</H2>

This screen lets you add, delete, modify, or change the order of your
address books.  The &quot;Add Abook&quot; command brings up a blank form to 
fill in.  If you are adding a remote address book on an IMAP server
you should fill in the name of the IMAP server.  Otherwise, leave
that field blank.  (Note that remote IMAP address books are a Pine
concept and are unlikely to interoperate with other mail clients.)
For a remote address book, fill in the name of the remote folder
in the Folder field.  This should be a folder which is used only for
this one purpose, not a general purpose folder you expect to store
messages in.
<P>If you are adding a local address book, fill in the
Folder Name field with a local file name (e.g., .addressbook).
<P>
<B>Please note:</B> Remote address books stored on an IMAP server are 
of an entirely different format (namely, a special-purpose 
&quot;mail folder&quot;) than that of the local addressbook familiar 
to Pine users.  Therefore, 
you cannot use &quot;add a remote address book&quot; to make an existing 
Pine .addressbook file you may have on a remote IMAP server accessible to 
Pine running on a different host.  
<P>

The &quot;Del Abook&quot; command allows you to remove an address book
from your configuration.  It will also ask you if you wish to remove
the data for that address book, which would erase all traces of the
address book if you answer Yes.
<P>

The &quot;Change&quot; command is similar to the &quot;Add Abook&quot; command.
The difference is that instead of adding a new address book to your
configuration, you are changing the configuration of an existing entry.
For example, you might want to correct a typing error or change a
nickname.  The &quot;Change&quot; command is not a move command.  If you
change the folder name or server name the data will not be moved for you.
<P>

The &quot;Shuffle&quot; command is used for two purposes.  If you shuffle
an address book toward another address book in the same group then
the order of those two address books will be swapped.  If you shuffle
the last Personal address book down towards the Global address book
section, it will become a Global address book.  If you shuffle
the first Global address book up it will become a Personal address
book.  The main difference between Personal and Global address
books is that Global address books are forced read-only.

<H2>Description of the Address Book Screen</H2>

This screen lets you edit and manage entries in your address book.  It
also acts as a short-cut for composing messages to people in the address
book.  When, from this screen, you press <!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->&quot;C&quot;<!--chtml endif--> for ComposeTo, the
message starts &quot;pre-addressed&quot; to whatever address book entry is
currently selected.  If you use the <!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F8<!--chtml else-->&quot;#&quot;<!--chtml endif--> for Role, you may first select a
role to use in your composition.
<P>
Pine's address book helps you keep a list of addresses you send email to so
you do not have to remember addresses that are often complex.  Each entry
in the address book has five fields, all of them optional.  The three
elements which are usually visible on the ADDRESS BOOK display, are: <DL>

	<P><DT>NICKNAME: <DD>A short easy-to-remember label to identify the entry.
	This is what you type in as you are addressing the message in the
	composer.  If there is a matching entry in your address book(s),
	Pine will extract the corresponding FullName and Address fields to
	generate the actual address for your message.

	<P><DT>FULLNAME: <DD>A longer field where you can put the full name 
of the
	person or organization.  Usually the full names are put in last
	name first so they sort nicely in alphabetical order.  Whatever
	you put as the name here will appear on the message when it is
	finally delivered.  Examples:<PRE>
	   Garcia Marquez, Gabriel
	   Henscheid, Eckhard
	   Pine-Info mailing list
	   Library materials renewal requests
	   Kim An-guk
	   &quot;George III, King of Great Britain, 1738-1820&quot;
</PRE>
(In the second-to-last example, no comma is used in the name so that 
the family name appears first in the address book and when the entry is 
used in the composer.
In the last example, retaining the commas is intended; 
double-quotation marks surround the name to 
prevent the transposition of its parts when the entry is used in 
the composer.)

	<P><DT>ADDRESS: <DD>This is the actual email address itself.  This must be
	a valid Internet address that conforms to the Internet message
	header standard, RFC-822.  (See also <A HREF="h_address_format">Explanation of Address formats</A>.)</DL>

The two fields which aren't usually visible are:<DL>

  <P><DT>FCC: <DD>The name of the folder you would like a copy of any outgoing
	message to this address to be saved in.  If this field is set, and
	this address is the first one in the message's To: header, then
	Pine will use this folder name for the FCC in lieu of the normal
	FCC folder name.

  <P><DT>COMMENTS: <DD>This field contains arbitrary text for your convenience.
	</DL>
<P>
Due to screen width limitations, these last two fields do not show up in
the normal ADDRESS BOOK display.  You may select the 
&quot;View/Update&quot; command to
view or modify them.  You may use the configuration variable
<A HREF="h_config_abook_formats">&quot;Addressbook-Formats&quot;</A>
to add these fields to your ADDRESS BOOK 
display, or to modify the format of the display.

<H2>Sorting the Address book</H2>

By default, address book entries are sorted alphabetically on the full
name with distribution lists sorted to the end.  Sorting can be changed by
resetting the address book sort rule in the Pine SETUP CONFIGURATION screen
--assuming you have &quot;write&quot; permission for the address book file.
<P>
Unlike the sorting of folders (which only changes presentation), sorting an
address book actually changes the file as it is kept on the computer.  For
this reason you won't be able to sort a shared or system-wide address
book.

<H2>Adding New Entries</H2>

The easiest way to add new entries to your address book is to use the
&quot;TakeAddr&quot; command when viewing a message.
This command allows you to take addresses from the header and body of the
message and put them into your address book, without having to type
them in.
<P>

To add a new entry from within the address book screen, use the AddNew
(<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F9<!--chtml else-->&quot;@&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command.
Use this command both for adding a simple alias and for adding a
distribution list.

<H2>Distribution Lists</H2>

Address book entries can be simple cases of aliases (a single nickname is linked
to a single email address) or distribution lists (a single nickname
pointing at more than one email address).  Each distribution list has a
nickname, a full name and a list of addresses.  The addresses may be
actual addresses or they may be other nicknames in your address book.
They may even refer to other distribution lists.
There's really no difference between a simple alias and a distribution list,
other than the number of addresses.
Therefore, you can turn a simple alias with one address into a distribution
list simply by adding more addresses.
To add entries to an existing list or alias
use the View/Update (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F4<!--chtml else-->&quot;&gt;&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command.  Delete (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F10<!--chtml else-->&quot;D&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) will delete
a single address from the list if the cursor is placed on the address;
it will delete the entire distribution list if the cursor is on the
nickname/fullname line.  View/Update may also be used to delete addresses
from a list.
<P>
Address field entries in distribution lists may take any one of three
forms: a nickname existing in any of the defined address books, a normal
address of the form &quot;jsmith@art.example.com&quot;, or a complete
fullname/address combination, e.g. &quot;John Smith
&lt;jsmith@art.example.com&gt;&quot;.
<P>
Distribution lists in Pine address books can only be used by the person or
people who have access to that address book.  They are not usually used to
implement discussion groups, but can be used to facilitate small
discussion groups if all the participants have access to the same shared
address book.

<H2>FCC and Comments</H2>

As mentioned above, each entry in the address book also has two other optional
fields, fcc and comments.  The command to look at or change either of these
is the same View/Update command used for all of the fields (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F4<!--chtml else-->&quot;&gt;&quot;<!--chtml endif-->).  The
comments field is just for your own use.  The fcc field overrides the
default fcc if this address is the first one on the To line.  The WhereIs
command may be used to search for particular strings in the address book,
including fields which are not visible (like comment and fcc by default).

<H2>Aggregate Operations</H2>

If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set&quot;</A>
is turned on, then the four commands &quot;Select&quot;,
&quot;Select Current&quot;, &quot;Zoom&quot;, and &quot;Apply&quot;
are available.  The two selection commands allow you to mark a set of
address book entries as being selected.  If you have more than one address
book, the selections may be in more than one of those address books.
The &quot;Zoom&quot; command will toggle between displaying only the selected
entries and all of the entries.  The &quot;Apply&quot; command allows you to
apply one of the regular address book commands to all of the selected
entries.  Usually the address book commands apply to only the entry
highlighted by the cursor.  The &quot;Apply&quot; command works with the
commands &quot;ComposeTo&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Print&quot;, 
&quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Forward&quot;, and &quot;Role&quot;.

<H2>Exporting and Forwarding Address book entries</H2>

Under the save option, when you use the Export (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F11<!--chtml else-->&quot;X&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command, the currently highlighted
address book entry is placed in a plain text file in your home directory
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, in the present configuration of your system, is
 &quot;<!--#echo var="HOME_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->
or current working directory
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, at least for your current Pine &quot;session,&quot; 
is &quot;<!--#echo var="CURRENT_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->, depending on the 
<A HREF="h_config_use_current_dir">&quot;Use-Current-Dir&quot;</A>
configuration setting.  If you have some entries selected and use the
Apply (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F7<!--chtml else-->&quot;A&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) Export command, all of the selected addresses will be
placed in the text file.
<P>
When you use the Forward (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F12<!--chtml else-->&quot;F&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) command, the currently highlighted
address book entry is placed in a special attachment and you are put into
the composer.  You can fill in some comments in the body of the message,
if you'd like, and send it to somebody else who uses Pine.  The recipient
may use the TakeAddr command on that message to insert the address book
entry you sent in their own address book.  If you have some entries
selected and use the Apply Forward command all of the selected entries
will be forwarded in a single message.  You may
use Apply (<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F7<!--chtml else-->&quot;A&quot;<!--chtml endif-->) Forward to forward a copy of an entire address book.
The recipient must be using Pine in order to receive this correctly.
One way for the recipient to handle this might be to create an empty
address book and then &quot;Take&quot; your forwarded address book entries into
that empty address book.

<H2>Multiple and/or Site-Wide Address books</H2>

You may have more than one personal address book.  In addition, there may
be one or more global address books.  This capability allows you to have
multiple personal address books (some of which may be shared) and it also
allows system administrators to implement site-wide address books that
contain entries for users on multiple machines within the organization.
<P><DL>
<DT>Searching. 
  <DD> If you enter a nickname when composing a message, your
  personal address books will be searched through in order, and then the
  global address book(s) searched. If more than one address book has an entry
  for the nickname, Pine uses the first one that it finds, so an entry in
  your personal address book would override a global address book entry. If
  after searching all the address books there is still no match, (Unix) Pine
  then searches the local host password file on the assumption that you have
  entered a local user name rather than an address book nickname.
  You may change the search order of your address books with the <!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->F3<!--chtml else-->$<!--chtml endif--> Shuffle
  command, but global address books are always searched after personal
  address books.

  <P><DT>Defining. 
  <DD> You define multiple personal address books in the 
  <A HREF="h_abook_config">SETUP AddressBooks</A> screen.  
  You can add as many as you like.  Global address books are usually
  site-wide address books defined by the System administrator, but
  you may define global address books of your own just like you define
  personal address books.

  <P><DT>Creating and updating. 
  <DD> Personal address books are normally created empty
  and populated by explicit additions from within Pine, e.g. via the
  TakeAddr command.  Unlike personal address books, global address books may
  not be modified/updated from within Pine; that is, they are Read-Only.
  Thus, global address books are created, populated and updated outside of
  Pine. They might be hand-edited, generated by a program from another
  database, or by copying an existing address book.  They might also be
  some other user's personal address book, and so be modified normally by
  that user but accessed Read-Only by you.  See the Pine Technical
  Notes document (included in the Pine distribution) for more information on
  this.

  <P><DT>Accessing.  
  <DD>There are two different types of address books in Pine.
  A local address book is stored in a regular file and the normal file
  access permissions apply.  A remote address book is stored on an IMAP
  server in a special folder which contains only messages pertaining to
  that address book.  The last message in the remote folder contains a
  copy of the address book data, and that data is copied to a local cache
  file in your home directory.  From there it is accessed just like a local
  address book.  The name of the cache file is kept track of in a special
  file called the
  <A HREF="h_config_abook_metafile">Remote-Abook-Metafile</A>,
  the name of which is stored in
  your Pine configuration file the first time you use a remote address book.
  Just as local Pine address books use a format that only Pine understands,
  remote Pine address books do the same and other mail reading programs
  are unlikely to be able to understand them.<P>
  While global address books are explicitly intended to be shared, there is
  nothing to prevent you from sharing a personal address book with other
  Pine users. This might be useful in the case of a small workgroup.
  However, it is recommended that updates to shared personal address books
  be done when other Pine users are not accessing the address book. Pine
  does not do any file-locking to manage concurrent updates to the
  addressbook, but it does check to see if the file has been modified before
  making any changes.  Consequently, inadvertent concurrent updates will
  only cause other Pine users to have to restart their address book
  operation, which will cause Pine to reopen the updated file.

  <P><DT>Converting to Remote.  
  <DD>The easiest way to convert an existing local
  address book into a remote address book is to create an empty new remote
  personal address book by typing &quot;A&quot; to execute the
  &quot;Add Pers Abook&quot; command in the SETUP Addressbook screen.
  Make sure you add a <EM>personal</EM> address book, not a <EM>global</EM>
  address book.
  After you have added the empty
  remote address book, go into the screen for the address book you wish
  to copy and &quot;Select&quot; &quot;All&quot;.
  This selects every entry in that
  address book.  Then type the command &quot;Apply Save&quot;.
  You will be asked for the address book to save to.  You may use ^P and ^N
  to get to the new empty address book, then hit RETURN and the addresses
  will be copied.
  At this point you'll probably want to unselect all the entries in the local
  address book before proceeding. You do that with
  &quot;Select&quot; &quot;unselect All&quot;.

<H2>Description of the Take Address Screen</H2>

This screen is designed to let you select one or more address/name
combinations from the current message and put them into your address book.
The cursor is initially placed on the line with the message author.
Other lines include the names of people and/or mailing lists who also
received the message.  Other people &quot;involved&quot; in the
message (e.g. the person named as Reply-To:) are also listed here.
<P>

The simple case is adding a new, single entry into your address book. To
do this, simply highlight the correct line and press 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F4.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;T&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
To create a new list or add to an existing list, switch the screen display
into List Mode by pressing
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F12.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;L&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
In List Mode, you select the
group of addresses you wish to manipulate by marking them with an
&quot;X&quot;.
The Set/Unset
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
(F9)
<!--chtml else-->
(&quot;X&quot;)
<!--chtml endif-->
command will turn the &quot;X&quot; on for the
highlighted address if it was off or turn it off if it was previously on.
The SetAll command will select all of the addresses, and the UnSetAll
command will turn off all the selections.  Once you've gotten the
selection the way you want it, you may create a new list by pressing
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F4.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;T&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>

In both the simple and list cases, after choosing to take the address,
you will be asked for the nickname of the entry.  Typing in a new name
creates the new entry/list.  Entering an existing nickname will replace
the entry (simple case) or add to the list (list case).  Alternatively,
you can press Ctrl-T at the nickname prompt and select an existing
nickname from your address book.
<P>

You will normally start in Single Mode, unless you used the Apply command
to startup the TakeAddr screen, in which case you will start in List Mode.
You may switch between the two modes at any time.  If you've already
selected several addresses in List Mode, those will be remembered when you
switch to Single Mode and then back to List Mode.  The set of addresses
that are pre-selected when you start in List Mode are the From addresses
of all of the messages you are operating on.  You may, of course, easily
erase those selections with the UnSetAll command.
<P>

If you have more than one writable address book, you will be prompted for
the name of the address book you wish to add the new entry to before
anything else. You can use ^N and ^P to choose among the defined address
books, or type in the address book name.
<P>

FOR MORE INFORMATION on addressing see
<A HREF="h_address_format">Explanation of Address formats</A>, and the

command will turn the &quot;X&quot; on for the
highlighted address if it was off or turn it off if it was previously on.
The SetAll command will select all of the addresses, and the UnSetAll
command will turn off all the selections.  Once you've gotten the
selection the way you want it, you may put the addresses in a file by typing
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F4.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;T&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->

<H1>Getting Help In PC-Pine</H1>

<P>
PC-Pine offers general and specific help text. From the <A
HREF="main_menu_tx">MAIN MENU</A>, you will find an overview in the MAIN
MENU HELP and the <A HREF="h_news">Release Notes</A>.  On all screens,
specific help for that screen is available from the toolbar Help menu or
with the 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F1&quot; key.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;?&quot; or &quot;Ctrl-G&quot; keys. &quot;Ctrl-G&quot; is used where
typing &quot;?&quot; would be mistaken as entering text.
<!--chtml endif-->

<P>
Although this version of Pine is for Microsoft Windows, it is not
considered a full &quot;Graphical User Interface&quot; application. 
Yet, many of the controls that Windows users are accustomed to seeing, 
such as scrollbars and toolbars, are available.

<P>
PC-Pine offers considerable mouse support.  You can view what is
&quot;click-able&quot; by dragging your mouse over any screen; when the
arrow cursor changes into a hand, you found something. Mouse-click
possibilities include navigating between screens and folders and
double-clicking on hyperlinks to open your Web browser.
Context-sensitive pop-up menus appear with a right-click on your PC-Pine
screen.  Examples of right-click options include &quot;copy&quot; after
selecting text to copy and &quot;View in New Window&quot; when you click
on a particular message in the Message Index. The menu choices available
to you will vary based upon what screen is open, where on the screen your
cursor is located, and even what action you have already taken.

<H2>Description of Composer</H2>

Pine has a built-in editing program which allows you to compose messages
without having to leave Pine.  The editor is designed to be very simple to
use so that you can get started writing email right away.

<P>
Messages are usually just text, about 80 columns wide.  Using upper and
lower case is encouraged.  On some systems the size limit of the message
is about 100,000 characters, which is about 2,000 lines.  You can include
punctuation and special characters found on most keyboards, but you can't
include characters with diacritical marks and certain special symbols.

<P>
Text automatically wraps as you type past the end of a line so you do not
have to hit return.  Using the
&quot;<A HREF="h_compose_justify">Justify</A>&quot; command,
you can also reformat text explicitly, perhaps after you have
deleted some text.

<P>
You can include other text files with the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_compose_readfile">Read File</A>&quot; command
which will prompt you for the name of the file to insert at the
current cursor postion.

<H1>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S BCC FIELD</H1>
The &quot;Bcc:&quot; (Blind carbon copy) header is used when you wish to send 
a copy of the message to one or more people whose addresses you do not
wish disclosed, either to reduce clutter or for confidentiality.
<P>
The format of the Bcc: field is just the same as the To: and Cc: fields in
the way the addresses are entered.  The recipients listed here will
receive a copy of the message, but --assuming your site's mail transport
software is properly configured-- their addresses will not show up in the
headers of the message, as delivered to all of the recipients.  The To:
and Cc:  recipients will not know a copy was sent to the Bcc: recipients.
<P>
Note: if there is no To: or Cc: or Lcc: address in the message, Pine
will automatically generate and place in the To: field a pseudo-address of 
  &quot;undisclosed-recipients: ;&quot;
or whatever string has been specified in the 
<A HREF="h_config_empty_hdr_msg">&quot;Empty-Header-Message&quot;</A>
variable.
<P>
The reason for this is to avoid embarrassment caused by some Internet
mail transfer software that interprets a &quot;missing&quot; To: header as 
an error and replaces it with an Apparently-to: header that may contain
the addresses you entered on the Bcc: line.  In addition, it may be
less disconcerting to Bcc: recipients to see <B>something</B> in the To: field.
<P>
You can manipulate what text ends up on the (originally) empty To:
field.  Just remember to put a colon and semicolon at the end of the
field, which is a special notation denoting that it is not a real address.

<H1>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S LCC FIELD</H1>
The &quot;Lcc:&quot; (List carbon copy) header is intended to be used when
you wish to send a message to a list of people but avoid having all
of their addresses visible, in order to reduce clutter when the
message is received.
<P>
It is similar to the 
<A HREF="h_composer_bcc">&quot;Bcc&quot; (Blind carbon copy) header</A> 
in that individual
addressees are hidden, but Lcc is designed to work specifically with
distribution lists you have created in your 
<A HREF="h_abook_opened">Pine Address Book</A>.  Placing
the nickname of the list on the Lcc line will result in the full name of
your Pine Address Book list being placed on the To: line of the message,
using a special notation that distinguishes it from a real address. You
must leave the To: line blank for your list name to appear there.
<P>
For example, if you have this list entered in your Address Book:<PRE>

	largo         Key Largo List       DISTRIBUTION LIST:
					   bogie@mgm.com
					   lauren@mgm.com
					   walter@mgm.com</PRE>


and you enter &quot;largo&quot; on the Lcc: line while composing a message, 
the result is:<PRE>

	To      : Key Largo List: ;
	Cc      :
	Bcc     :
	Fcc     : sent-mail
	Lcc     : Key Largo List &lt;bogie@mgm.com&gt;,
		  lauren@mgm.com,
		  walter@mgm.com
	Subject :</PRE>

Each recipient listed on the Lcc: line receives a copy of the message
without their address being visible (as though they were listed on the
Bcc: line). The colon-semicolon notation used to put the full-name of the
list on the To: line is a special address format that doesn't specify any
actual addressees, but does give some information to the recipients of the
message.
<P>
Note: if after entering an LCC, you delete the list name that is placed
on the To: line, then recipients will see <PRE>

Most people should not need this header. The Reply-To: header is used in
cases where you would like replies to your messages to be directed to an
address other than your normal &quot;From:&quot; address.  This is atypical, 
but can happen when you use multiple machines and do not have the same account
name on each one, or when you wish to direct certain replies to accounts
or folders designated for specific classes of correspondence.

<H1>THE MESSAGE COMPOSER'S ATTCHMNT FIELD</H1>

The &quot;Attchmnt:&quot; field is where you specify what file or
files you'd like attached to
the message you are composing.  Those files must reside on the machine
running Pine. If your file is on a PC or Mac and you run Pine with an
account on a Unix machine, you'll have to transfer it before attaching it.
Contact local computer support people for assistance with transferring.

<P>
The file name
given can be an absolute file path name for your system
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
(for example, &quot;H:&#92;SIGFILES&#92;FULLINFO.TXT&quot;), a file
with a relative pathname, or simply a file name without
drive or directory specification.  
<!--chtml else-->
(for example, &quot;/tmp/exported.earlier&quot; on Unix hosts), 
a file in your home directory, or a file path relative to your 
home directory.  In Unix Pine, you may use &quot;~&quot; to refer to 
your home directory or &quot;~user&quot; to refer to another
account's home directory.
<!--chtml endif--><P>
No wild card characters may be used.
<P>If the 
<A HREF="h_config_use_current_dir">&quot;Use-Current-Dir&quot;</A>
feature is set, names are relative to your current working directory 
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, at least for your current Pine &quot;session,&quot; 
is &quot;<!--#echo var="CURRENT_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->
rather than your home directory
<!--chtml if pinemode="running"-->
(which, in the present configuration of your system, is
 &quot;<!--#echo var="HOME_DIR"-->&quot;) 
<!--chtml endif-->
.
<P>
Pine uses MIME encoding for attachments, so binaries and files of any
length can safely be delivered to any MIME-capable mail reading program.
If you send an attachment to someone who does not have a MIME-capable mail
reading program yet, then the main message text will be readable, but
attachments (even attachments which are just plain text) are not.
<P>

Typing the filename on the Attchmnt: line achieves the same
result as using the 
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
F6
<!--chtml else-->
Ctrl-J
<!--chtml endif--> command.
<P>

If you Forward a message with attachments, you may delete them from your
Forwarded message by editing the Attchmnt header line.

<TITLE>Addressbook Fullname Explained</TITLE>

<BODY>
This is the full name field for this entry.  If this is going to be a
distribution list (more than one address), it should be a descriptive
phrase describing the list.  It will be included in the mail header if you
put the list in the To: or CC: field, or in the To: line if you put the
list in the Lcc: field.  It's OK to leave this field blank (and OK to
leave any of the other fields blank, too). If this address book entry is
going to be a simple entry with just one address, then this field is the
person's name. When you send mail to this entry, this is the field to the
left of the brackets. That is, it is the most readable part of the 
address. For example, in the sample address:
<PRE>
       John Doe &lt;jdoe@some.domain&gt;
</PRE>
"John Doe" is the full name field. If you are sorting your address book
with one of the options that uses full names, then it might be useful to
enter the full name as "Last, First", for example:
<PRE>
       Doe, John
</PRE>
so that it will be sorted using Doe instead of John. This will be changed
back into John Doe when you use it.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: Combined-Addrbook-Display</H1>

This feature affects the address book display screens.
Normally, expanding an address book from the ADDRESS BOOK LIST screen
will cause the remaining address books and directory servers to disappear
from the screen, leaving only the entries of the expanded address book.
If this feature is set, then the other address books will remain on the screen,
so that all of the address books can be present at once.

<P>
The way that commands work won't be changed.
For example, the Select All command will select all of the entries in the
current address book, not all of the entries in all of the address books.
The WhereIs command will change a little.
It will search through all of the text on the screen plus all of the entries
from expanded address books.

<P>
The available options include:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>default</DT>
<DD>The color of the titlebar will be the color you set for the
<A HREF="h_config_title_color">Title Color</A>.
The Title Color may be set by using the
<A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.
</DD>

<DT>indexline</DT>
<DD>The color of the titlebar will be the same as the color of the
index line corresponding to the message being viewed.
The rules which determine what color the index line will be may be set
up by going to the Setup/Rules/Indexcolor screen.
If the index line for a message is not colored explicitly by the
Indexcolor rules, then the titlebar will be colored the same as for
the &quot;default&quot; option above (which is not the same color that
the index line itself will have).
</DD>

<DT>reverse-indexline</DT>
<DD>This is similar to the &quot;indexline&quot; option except the
foreground and background colors from the corresponding index line will
be reversed.
For example, if the index line color is red letters on a white background,
then the titlebar will be white letters on a red background.
If the index line for a message is not colored explicitly by the

<H1>OPTION: Current-Indexline-Style</H1>

This option affects the colors used to display the current line in the
MESSAGE INDEX screen.
If you do not have Index Color Rules defined, then this option will
have no effect.
Those Rules may be defined by going to the Setup/Rules/Indexcolor screen.

<P>
The available options include:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>flip-colors</DT>
<DD>This is the default.
If an index line is colored because it matches one of your
Index Color Rules, then its colors will be reversed when it is the currently
highlighted line.
For example, if the line is normally red text on a blue background, then
when it is the current line it will be drawn as blue text on a red background.
<P>
The rest of the option values all revert to this flip-colors behavior if
there is no Reverse Color defined.
</DD>

<DT>reverse</DT>
<DD>With this option the Reverse color is always used to highlight the
current line.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-fg</DT>
<DD>The foreground part of the Reverse Color is used to highlight
the current line.
If this would cause the text to be unreadable (because the foreground and
background colors are the same) or if it would cause no change in the
color of the index line, then the colors are flipped instead.
<P>
Some people think this works particularly well if you use different
background colors to emphasize &quot;interesting&quot; lines,
but always with the same Normal foreground color,
and you use a different foreground color for the Reverse Color.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-fg-no-ambiguity</DT>
<DD>With the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; rule above, it is possible that
the resulting color will be exactly the same as the regular Reverse
Color.
That can lead to some possible confusion because an
&quot;interesting&quot;
line which is the current line will be displayed exactly the same as a
non-interesting line which is current.
You can't tell whether the line is just a regular current line or if it is
an &quot;interesting&quot; current line by looking at the color.
Setting the option to this value removes that ambiguity.
It is the same as the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; setting unless the resulting
interesting current line would look just like a non-interesting current line.
In that case, the interesting line's colors are simply flipped (like in the
default behavior).
<P>
As an alternative way to preserve the line's interestingness in this case,
you may find that using both a different foreground and a different
background color for the interesting line will help.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-bg</DT>
<DD>The background part of the Reverse Color is used to highlight
the current line.
If this would cause the text to be unreadable (because the foreground and
background colors are the same) or if it would cause no change in the
color of the index line, then the colors are flipped instead.
<P>
Some people think this works particularly well if you use different
foreground colors to emphasize &quot;interesting&quot; lines,
but always with the same Normal background color,
and you use a different background color for the Reverse Color.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-bg-no-ambiguity</DT>
<DD>As with the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; case, the &quot;reverse-bg&quot;
rule may also result in a color which is exactly the same as the regular
Reverse Color.
Setting the option to this value removes that ambiguity.
It is the same as the &quot;reverse-bg&quot; setting unless the resulting
current line has the same color as the Reverse Color.
In that case, the interesting line's colors are simply flipped (like in the
default behavior).

<H1>LDAP FEATURE: Lookup-Addrbook-Contents</H1>

Normally implicit LDAP lookups from the composer are done only for the
strings you type in from the composer screen. In other words, you type in
something in the To or CC field and press return, then the string is looked up.
First that string is looked up in your address books. If a match is found
there, then the results of that match are looked up again. If you place
a string in your address book that you want to have looked up on the LDAP
directory server, you need to turn on this feature. If you set this feature
for a server, you almost always will also want to set the
<A HREF="h_config_ldap_opts_impl">&quot;Use-Implicitly-From-Composer&quot;</A>
feature. An example might serve to best illustrate this feature.
<P>
If an LDAP lookup of &quot;William Clinton&quot; normally returns an
entry with an
address of pres@whitehouse.gov, then you might put an entry in your address
book that looks like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Nickname = bill</SAMP></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER><SAMP>Address = &quot;William Clinton&quot;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Now, when you type &quot;bill&quot; into an
address field in the composer Pine will
find the &quot;bill&quot; entry in your address book.
It will replace &quot;bill&quot; with
&quot;William Clinton&quot;.
It will then search for an entry with that nickname
in your address book and not find one. If this feature
is set, Pine will then attempt to lookup
&quot;William Clinton&quot; on the LDAP server and find the entry with address
pres@whitehouse.gov.
<P>
A better way to accomplish the same thing is probably to use the feature
<A HREF="h_config_ldap_opts_ref">&quot;Save-Search-Criteria-Not-Result&quot;</A>.

<H1>LDAP FEATURE: Save-Search-Criteria-Not-Result</H1>

Normally when you save the results of an LDAP directory lookup to your
address book the results of the lookup are saved. If this feature is set
and the entry being saved was found on this directory server, then the
search criteria is saved instead of the results of the search. When this
address book entry is used in the future, instead of copying the results
from the address book the directory lookup will be done again. This could
be useful if the copied result might become stale because the data on
the directory server changes (for example, the entry's email address changes).
You probably don't want to set this feature if the server is at all slow or
unreliable.
<P>
The way this actually works is that instead of saving the email address
in your address book, Pine saves enough information to look up the same
directory entry again. In particular, it saves the server name and the
distinguished name of the entry. It's possible that the server administrators
might change the format of distinguished names on the server, or that the
entry might be removed from the server. If Pine notices this, you will be warned
and a backup copy of the email address will be used. You may want to create
a new entry in this case, since you will get the annoying warning every
time you use the old entry. You may do that by Saving the entry to a new
nickname in the same address book. You will be asked whether or not you
want to use the backup email address.

Pine normally attempts to use version 2 of the LDAP protocol.
When the version 3 protocol is used the server will output the results

Since Pine is not currently able to handle this UTF-8 output, it does not
use version 3 protocol.
However, there are some servers which do not support version 2 of the protocol
and only support version 3.
Some people have found that even though Pine does not handle
everything correctly, the results are still usually usable and may be
better than nothing.

<H1>LDAP OPTION: Search-Type</H1>

This affects the way that LDAP searches are done.
In particular, this tells the server where to look for the string to be matched.
If set to &quot;name&quot; then the string that is being searched for will
be compared with the string in the
&quot;Name&quot; field on the server
(technically, it is the &quot;commonname&quot; field on the server).
&quot;Surname&quot; means we're looking for a
match in the &quot;Surname&quot; field on the
server (actually the &quot;sn&quot; field).
&quot;Givenname&quot; really is &quot;givenname&quot;
and &quot;email&quot; is the electronic mail address (this is actually the field
called &quot;mail&quot; or &quot;electronicmail&quot; on the server).
The other three types are combinations of
the types listed so far. &quot;Name-or-email&quot;
means the string should appear
in either the &quot;name&quot; field OR the &quot;email&quot; field.
Likewise, &quot;surname-or-givenname&quot;
means &quot;surname&quot; OR &quot;givenname&quot;
and &quot;sur-or-given-or-name-or-email&quot; means the obvious thing.
<P>
This search TYPE is combined with the
search <A HREF="h_config_ldap_searchrules">RULE</A>
to form the actual search query.
<P>
The usual default value for this
option is &quot;sur-or-given-or-name-or-email&quot;.
This type of search may be slow on some servers.
Try &quot;name-or-email&quot;, which is often
faster, or just &quot;name&quot; if the performance seems to be a problem.
<P>
Some servers have been configured with different attribute names for
these four fields.
In other words, instead of using the attribute name &quot;mail&quot;
for the email address field, the server might be configured to use something
else, for example, &quot;rfc822mail&quot; or &quot;internetemailaddress&quot;.

This variable may be set to the string representation of an LDAP search
filter (see RFC1960). In the places where you want the address string to be
substituted in, put a '%s' in this filter string. Here are some examples:
<P>
A &quot;Search-Type&quot; of &quot;name&quot; with &quot;Search-Rule&quot; of &quot;begins-with&quot;
is equivalent to the &quot;Custom-Search-Filter&quot;
<PRE>
     (cn=%s*)
</PRE>
When you try to match against the string &quot;string&quot; the program replaces
the &quot;%s&quot; with &quot;string&quot; (without the quotes). You may have multiple &quot;%s&quot;'s and
they will all be replaced with the string. There is a limit of 10 &quot;%s&quot;'s.
<P>
A &quot;Search-Type&quot; of &quot;name-or-email&quot; with &quot;Search-Rule&quot;
of &quot;contains&quot; is equivalent to
<PRE>
     (|(cn=*%s*)(mail=*%s*))
</PRE>
<P>
If your server uses a different attribute <EM>name</EM> than
Pine uses by default,
(for example, it uses &quot;rfc822mail&quot; instead of &quot;mail&quot;),
then you may be able to use one or more of the four attribute configuration
options instead of defining a custom filter:
<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="h_config_ldap_email_attr">&quot;EmailAttribute&quot;</A>
</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="h_config_ldap_cn_attr">&quot;NameAttribute&quot;</A>

<H1>Addressbook Lists</H1>

This is a list of addresses to send to when sending to this address book
entry.  Each member of the list may be an address or another nickname from
any of your address books.  If it is an address, it is OK to include the
full name field as well as the electronic address portion of that address.
For example, the following are all legitimate entries in this field:

<DL><DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DD>john&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a nickname in your address book)
<DD>jdoe@some.domain
<DD>John Doe &lt;jdoe@some.domain&gt;
</DL>

The addresses should be listed separated by commas, just like you would
enter them from the composer.

<P>

The only difference between a distribution list and a simple entry with a
single address, is that a distribution list has more than one address   
listed in the Addresses: field, whereas a simple personal entry has just  
one address.

<P>

For individual address book entries, if there is a full name in the
Fullname: field (filling in the Fullname: field is not required), it is
used.  If the full name is specified in the Address: field and not in the
Fullname: field, then the full name from the Address: field is used.

<P>

If you type the nickname of a distribution list from one of your address 
books in the Lcc: field, then the full name of that list is used in the  
To: field.  If you put a list in the To: or Cc: fields, that list will be
expanded into all of its addresses.  If the list has a full name, then
that will appear at the beginning of the addresses.

<DL><DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DD>Sewing Club &lt;john@somewhere&gt;, nancy@something.else, Sal
&lt;sal@here.there&gt;
</DL>

If the first address in the distribution list also has a full name, then
the list full name and that full name are combined into something like the
following:

<DL><DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DD>Sewing Club -- John Smith &lt;john@somewhere&gt;
</DL>


If you specify a list via Lcc, the full name is used in the To: line.  If
you specify a list in the To: or Cc: fields, then it uses the same method
as for individual entries for filling in the full name.

<P>

<H1>&quot;To:&quot; Pattern Explained</H1>

Any text you enter as the &quot;To pattern&quot;
will be compared to the recipients from the To: line of
the message being scored.
When the text you entered matches
all or part of the To: line of a message, then the Score Value
you have specified will be added to the score for the message.
(Any other non-blank parts of the Pattern must match, too.)
<P>

You may enter a complete email address, part of an address, or a
list of addresses or partial addresses.
For example:
<P>

<PRE>
 To pattern = friend@public.com

 To pattern = rated.net

 To pattern = xxx@adults.com
              admin@msn.com
              fool@motleyfool.com
</PRE>

<P>
Each of those are valid To patterns.
<P>

Messages match those patterns if any of the
addresses in the To: line of the message contains the pattern.
If the pattern is a list of patterns
(like the last example above) then it is a match if any of the patterns in
the list match any of the addresses in the To: line.
(It is not possible to specify two addresses which must <EM>BOTH</EM> be
present for a match.
It is only possible to specify that <EM>EITHER</EM> address1 <EM>OR</EM>
address2 must be present.
That is exactly what using a list does.)
<P>

Some messages may be &quot;bounced&quot; to you, and will
have a &quot;Resent-To:&quot; header line.
If the message contains a Resent-To: line, Pine will look for
matches to your &quot;To patterns&quot; there, and <EM>NOT</EM> in
the original To: line.
<P>

When entering a pattern, you may choose an address from your address book
with the &quot;T&quot; command.
<P>

It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the To Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the To pattern so that it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if there are no matches between the
addresses in the To: line and the list of To patterns.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
the pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!frizzle&quot; into the To
pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>
<PRE>
 To pattern = !frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
This means you want to match the 8 character sequence &quot;!frizzle&quot;.
In order to match messages which do not have &quot;frizzle&quot; in
their To field, first type the characters &quot;frizzle&quot; followed
by carriage return for the value of the To pattern, then negate it
by typing the &quot;!&quot; command.
It should end up looking like
<P>
<PRE>
 ! To pattern = frizzle
</PRE>
<P>
You are not limited to using the six standard header patterns which are
normally shown (To, From, Sender, Cc, News, and Subject).
You may add any other header to a Pattern by
using the &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command to specify a different
message header line; and then the Add or Change command to fill in
a pattern for the new header line, just like you would for a standard header.
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple
values in a pattern field, you have to escape comma with a backslash (&#92;) if
you want to include a literal comma in the field.
In other words, if you type a backslash followed by a comma it will
be interpreted as a comma by Pine, instead of as a separator between
pattern values.
All other backslashes are literal backslashes and should not be escaped.

<H1>Recipient Pattern Explained</H1>

This is just like the &quot;To pattern&quot; except that it is compared with
the addresses from both the To: line and the Cc: line of the
message instead of just the addresses from the To: line.
In other words, it is considered a match if the pattern matches
<EM>EITHER</EM> an address in the To: line <EM>OR</EM> an address
in the Cc: line.
(Notice that defining the Recipient pattern does not have the same
effect as defining both the To and Cc patterns.
Recipient is To <EM>OR</EM> Cc; not To <EM>AND</EM> Cc.
It is equivalent to having two different rules;
one with a To pattern and the other with the same Cc pattern.)
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple
values in a pattern field, you have to escape comma with a backslash (&#92;) if
you want to include a literal comma in the field.
In other words, if you type a backslash followed by a comma it will
be interpreted as a comma by Pine, instead of as a separator between
pattern values.
All other backslashes are literal backslashes and should not be escaped.

<H1>Character Set Pattern Explained</H1>

A message may use one or more character sets.
This part of the Pattern matches messages which make use of
certain specified character sets.
It will be considered a match if a message uses any of the character
sets in the list you give here.

<P>
When filling in a value for this field, you may use
the &quot;T&quot; command, which presents you with a large list of
possible character sets to choose from.
You may also just type in the name of a character set, and it need not
be one that Pine knows about.

<P>
Besides actual character set names (for example, ISO-8859-7, KOI8-R, or
GB2312) you may also use some shorthand names that Pine provides.
These names are more understandable shorthand names for sets of 
character set names.
Two examples are &quot;Cyrillic&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot;.
Selecting one of these shorthand names is equivalent to selecting all of
the character sets that make up the set.
You can see all of these shorthand names and the lists of character sets
they stand for by typing the &quot;T&quot; command.

<P>
For the purposes of this Pattern,
Pine will search through a message for all of the text parts and
collect the character sets declared for each part.
It will also look in the Subject line for a character set used there.
Pine does not actually look at the text of the message or the text
of the Subject to determine if a declared character set is actually
used, it looks only at the declarations themselves in the MIME part headers
and in the Subject.

<P>
It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the Character Set Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the Character Set pattern so that
it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if none of the character sets in the
list are used in a message.
<P>
Don't make the mistake of putting the &quot;!&quot; in the data field for
the pattern.
For example, if you type the characters &quot;!GB2312&quot; into the
Character Set pattern, the pattern will look like:
<P>

<H1>Categorizer Command Explained</H1>

This is a command that is run with its standard input set to the message
being checked and its standard output discarded.
The full directory path should be specified.
The command will be run and then its exit status will be checked against
the Exit Status Interval, which defaults to just the value zero.
If the exit status of the command falls in the interval, it is considered
a match, otherwise it is not a match.
<P>

This option may actually be a list of commands.
The first one that exists and is executable is used.
That makes it possible to use the same configuration with Unix Pine and
PC-Pine.
<P>

If none of the commands in the list exists and is executable then the rule
is <EM>not</EM> a match.
If it is possible that the command may not exist, you should be careful
to structure your rules so that nothing destructive
happens when the command does not exist.
For example, you might have a filter that filters away spam when there is
a match but does nothing when there is not a match.
That would cause no harm if the command didn't exist.
However, if you have a filter which filters away spam when there is not
a match and keeps it when there is a match, that would filter everything
if the categorizer command didn't exist.

<H1>Categorizer Command Example</H1>

Bogofilter
(<A HREF="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/</A>)
is a mail filter that attempts to classify mail as spam or
non-spam using statistical analysis of the message content.
When run with no arguments and a message as standard input, it exits with
exit status 0 if it thinks a message is spam and 1 if it thinks
it is not spam.
To use bogofilter as your Categorizer Command you would simply set Command to
the pathname of the bogofilter program.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Exit status of zero is what you are interested in, so you'd set the
Exit Status Interval to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Exit Status Interval = (0,0)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

In order to prevent downloading an entire huge message to check for spam, you
might want to set the Character Limit to a few thousand characters (the
assumption being that the spam will reveal itself in those characters)
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Character Limit = 50000</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

You would probably use bogofilter in a Pine Filter Rule, and have the action
be to move the message to a spam folder.
It would usually be wise to also check the &quot;Message is Recent&quot;
part of the rule so that messages are only checked when they first arrive,
and to restrict the Current Folder Type to just your INBOX.
The reason for checking only Recent messages is to save the time it takes
to run bogofilter on each message.
As an experiment, you might start out by using this in an Indexcolor Rule
instead of a Filter Rule.
In that case, you probably wouldn't check the Recent checkbox.
<P>
The use described above assumes that you are somehow maintaining bogofilter's
database of words associated with spam and non-spam messages.
One way to start your database would be to select a bunch of spam messages
in Pine (you might Save spam messages to a special folder or use Pine's
Select command to select several) and then Apply
(<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set</A>)
a pipe command to the spam messages.
For example, you could have a shell script or an alias
called <EM>this_is_spam</EM> which would simply be the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -s</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

It is probably best to use the pipe command's Raw Text, With Delimiter,
and Free Output options,
which are at the bottom of the screen when you type the pipe command.
That's because bogofilter expects the raw message as input, and uses
the Delimiters to tell when a new message starts.
You would not need to use a separate pipe for each message, because
bogofilter can handle multiple messages at once.
<P>
Similarly, you would select a group of non-spam messages
and run them through a <EM>this_is_nonspam</EM> script
that was something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -n</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

For the more adventurous, the next step might be to automate the upkeep of
the bogofilter database.
It might make more sense to have bogofilter be part of the delivery process,
but it is also possible to do it entirely from within Pine.
Instead of using just plain &quot;bogofilter&quot; as the Categorizer Command,
the &quot;-u&quot; argument will cause bogofilter to update the database.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter -u</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You'd want a couple more aliases or shell scripts called something like
<EM>change_to_spam</EM>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -Ns</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and
<EM>change_to_nonspam</EM>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>bogofilter -Sn</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When you run across a message in your INBOX that should have been
classified as spam you would pipe it to the change_to_spam script, and
when you run across a message in your spam folder that should have been
left in your INBOX you would pipe it through change_to_nonspam.

<P>
There is a technical problem with this approach.
Pine may check your filters more than once.
In particular, every time you start Pine the filters will be checked for
each message.
Also, if you have any filters which depend on message state (New, Deleted, etc.)
then Pine will recheck for matches in messages which have changed state
at the time you close the folder and before expunging.
This is usually ok.
However, in this case it is a problem because the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter -u</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
has the side effect of updating the database.
So you run the risk of updating the database multiple times for a single
message instead of updating it just once per message.
There are some ways to work around this problem.
What you need is a way to mark the message after you have run the filter.
One way to mark messages is with the use of a keyword (say &quot;Bogo&quot;).
Besides having the filter move the message to a spam folder, also have it
set the Bogo keyword.
(Note that you will have to set up the &quot;Bogo&quot; keyword in the
<A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A> option in Setup/Config.)
This rule can only set the Bogo keyword for the messages which it matches.
You will also need to add a second rule right after this one that
matches all the messages which don't have the Bogo keyword set
(put the keyword in the Keyword pattern and toggle
the Not with the ! command)
and takes the action of setting it.
Then change the &quot;bogofilter -u&quot; rule so that it won't be a match
(and so it won't re-run the bogofilter command) if the keyword is already
set.
<P>
What you will end up with is a rule which runs &quot;bogofilter -u&quot;
on all messages which don't have the Bogo keyword set.
This will have the side effect of inserting that message in the bogofilter
database, match or not.
If this rule matches (it is spam), the Bogo keyword will be set and
the message will be moved to a spam folder.
If it does not match, the
following rule will mark the message by turning on the keyword.
This second rule should be a non-terminating
(<A HREF="h_config_filt_opts_nonterm">Dont-Stop-Even-if-Rule-Matches</A>)
rule so that it doesn't stop the filtering process before the rest of
your rules are consulted.

<P>
In summary, the first rule is something like
<PRE>
  Nickname          = bogofilter -u rule
  Current Folder Type =
               (*) Specific
                   Folder = INBOX

  ! Keyword pattern = Bogo

  External Categorizer Commands =
       Command              = /usr/local/bin/bogofilter -u
       Exit Status Interval = (0,0)
       Character Limit      = <No Value Set: using "-1">  (optionally set this)

  Filter Action =
       (*) Move
           Folder = spam
  
  Set These Keywords   = Bogo
</PRE>
<P>
and the following rule is
<PRE>
  Nickname          = Set Bogo Keyword
  Current Folder Type =
               (*) Specific
                   Folder = INBOX

  ! Keyword pattern = Bogo

  Filter Action =
       (*) Just Set Message Status

  Set These Keywords   = Bogo

  Features =
      [X]  dont-stop-even-if-rule-matches
</PRE>
<P>
If it is possible for you to insert bogofilter in the delivery process instead
of having it called from Pine you could prevent having to wait
for the bogofilter processing while you read your mail.
You would have bogofilter add a header to the message at the time of delivery
which identified it as spam or nonspam.
With this method, you could avoid using a Categorizer Command while running Pine,
and just match on the header instead.
You might still want to use the scripts mentioned above to initialize the
database or to re-classify wrongly classified messages.

<P>
Finally, it isn't for the faint-hearted,
but it is also possible to run bogofilter from PC-Pine.
You can install Cygwin from
<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</A> and
then compile bogofilter in the cygwin environment, and run it from
within PC-Pine.
You would end up with a Categorizer command that looked something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Command = C:&#92;cygwin&#92;bin&#92;bogofilter.exe -u</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Note that the &quot;.exe&quot; extension is explicit,
and that the bogofilter.exe executable should be in the same directory
as cygwin1.dll.

The categorizer command is run and the result is the exit status of

If that exit status falls in the Exit Status Interval
then it is considered a match, otherwise it is not a match.
Of course for the entire rule to match, it must also be checked against
the other defined parts of the Pattern.
<P>
The Exit Status Interval defaults to the single value 0 (zero).
If you define it, it should be set to something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_exit_value,max_exit_value)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_exit_value&quot; and &quot;max_exit_value&quot; are integers.
The special values &quot;INF&quot; and &quot;-INF&quot; may be used for large
positive and negative integers.
<P>
Actually, a list of intervals may be used if you wish.
A list would look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_exit_value1,max_exit_value1),(min_exit_value2,max_exit_value2),...</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
When there is an Exit Status Interval defined, it is a match if the exit status
of the categorizer command is contained in any of the intervals.
The intervals include both endpoints.
<P>
The default interval is

When there is an Age Interval defined, it is a match if the age, in days, of
the message is contained in the interval.
The interval includes both endpoints.
If the option is set to a list of intervals then it is a match if the
age of the message is contained in any of the intervals.
<P>
Even though this option is called Age, it isn't actually
the <EM>age</EM> of the message.
Instead, it is how many days ago the message arrived in one of your folders.
If the current time is a little past midnight, then a message that arrived
just before midnight arrived yesterday, even though the message is only
a few minutes old.
By default, the date being used is not the date in the Date
header of the message.
It is the date that the message arrived in one of your folders.
When you Save a message from one folder to another that arrival date
is preserved.
If you would like to use the date in the Date header that is possible.
Turn on the option
<A HREF="h_config_filt_opts_sentdate">&quot;Use-Date-Header-For-Age&quot;</A>

<P>
A value of 0 is today, 1 is yesterday, 2 is the day before yesterday, and so on.
The age interval
<P>

<H1>Current Folder Type Explained</H1>

The Current Folder Type is part of the role's Pattern.
It refers to the type of the currently open folder, which is the folder
you were last looking at from the MESSAGE INDEX or MESSAGE TEXT screen.
In order for a role to be considered a match, the current folder must
be of the type you set here.
The three types &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, and &quot;Email&quot; are
all what you might think.
<P>
If the Current Folder Type for a role's Pattern is set to &quot;News&quot;, for
example, then
that role will only be a match if the current folder is a newsgroup and
the rest of the Pattern matches.
The value &quot;Specific&quot; may be used when you want to limit the match
to a specific folder (not just a specific type of folder), or to a list of
specific folders.
<P>
In order to match a specific folder you Select the &quot;Specific&quot;
button <EM>AND</EM> fill in
the name (or list of names) of
the folder in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field.
If the current folder is any of the folders in the list, that is considered
a match.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;,
the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are a couple samples of specific folder names:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.example.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field is to use
the &quot;T&quot; command which is available when the &quot;Folder List&quot; line is
highlighted, or to use the &quot;Take&quot; command with the configuration
feature
<A HREF="h_config_enable_role_take">&quot;Enable-Rules-Under-Take&quot;</A>
turned on.
Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Folder List&quot; line unless the
Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Specific&quot;, and any value that
&quot;Folder List&quot; has is ignored unless the type
is set to &quot;Specific&quot;.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check a Pattern.

<P>
If it is set to &quot;Delete&quot;, then the message which matches the
Pattern will be deleted from the open folder.

next line of the screen.
A list of folders separated by commas may be given, in which case the
message will be copied to all of the folders in the list before it is
deleted.
<P>
If it is set to neither of those two values (it is set to the value
labeled &quot;Just Set Message Status&quot;) then the message status
setting will happen
but the message will not be deleted or moved.
<P>
If you are Moving a message you may also set Message Status if you wish.

<P>
There are a few tokens which may be used in the names in the Folder List.
They are all related to the date on which the filtering is taking place.
The tokens are words surrounded by underscores.
For example, if you want your filter to move messages to a folder named
<P><CENTER><SAMP>abc-year-mon</SAMP></CENTER><P>
you could specify the folder as
<P><CENTER><SAMP>abc-_CURYEAR_-_CURMONTHABBREV_</SAMP></CENTER><P>

<H1>Current Folder Type Explained</H1>

The Current Folder Type is part of the Filtering rule's Pattern.
It refers to the type of the folder for which the filtering is being done.
In order for a rule to be considered a match, the current folder must
be of the type you set here.
The three types &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, and &quot;Email&quot; are
all what you might think.
<P>
If the Current Folder Type for a Pattern is set to &quot;News&quot;, for
example, then
that Pattern will only match if the current folder is a newsgroup and
the rest of the Pattern matches.
The value &quot;Specific&quot; may be used when you want to limit the match
to a specific folder (not just a specific type of folder), or to a list of
specific folders.
<P>
In order to match a specific folder you Select the &quot;Specific&quot;
button <EM>AND</EM> fill in
the name (or list of names) of
the folder in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field.
If the current folder is any of the folders in the list, that is considered
a match.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;, the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are a couple samples of specific folder names:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.example.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder List&quot; field is to use
the T command which is available when the &quot;Folder List&quot; line is
highlighted.
Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Folder List&quot; line unless the
Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Specific&quot;, and any value that
&quot;Folder List&quot; has is ignored unless the type
is set to &quot;Specific&quot;.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check a Pattern.
For this reason, the default Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Email&quot;.
For example, a rule with a Current Folder Type of either
&quot;Any&quot; or &quot;News&quot; may cause the filtering to happen
more slowly when opening a newsgroup.

New means that the message is Unseen.
It could have been in your mailbox for a long time but if you haven't looked

This option gives you a way to match messages which have a From or
a Reply-To address
which is in one of your address books.
Only the simple entries in your address books are searched.
Address book distribution lists are ignored!
<P>
This part of the Pattern may have one of five possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The value &quot;Yes, in any address book&quot; means either the From address
or the Reply-To address of the message must be in at least one of your
address books in order to be a match.
The value &quot;No, not in any address book&quot;
means neither the From nor the Reply-To addresses may
be in any of your address books in order to be a match.
<P>
The values &quot;Yes, in specific address books&quot; and
&quot;No, not in any of specific address books&quot; are similar but instead
of depending on all address books you are allowed to give a list of address
books to look in.
Usually this would be a single address book but it may be a
list of address books as well.
For each of these &quot;specific&quot; address book options you Select which
of the Specific options you want (Yes or No) <EM>AND</EM> fill in the
name (or list of names) of the address book in the
&quot;Abook List&quot; field.

The easiest way to fill in the Abook List field it to use
the &quot;T&quot; command which is available when the &quot;Abook List&quot;
line is highlighted.
Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Abook List&quot; line unless the

Here are some technical details.
The way that Pine decides if it is the beginning of the month or not is
to compare today's date with the date stored in the

If the month of today's date is later than the month stored in the variable,

<H1>Initialize Values From Role Explained</H1>

This is a power user feature.
You will usually want to leave this field empty.
The value of this field is the nickname of another one of your roles.
The Action values from that other role
are used as the initial values of the Action items for this role.
If you put something in any of the action fields for this role, that will
override whatever was in the corresponding field of the initializer role.
<P>
You might use this field if the &quot;Action&quot; part of one of your roles
is something you want to use in more than one role.
Instead of filling in those action values again for each role, you
may give the nickname of the role where the values are filled in.
It's just a shortcut way to define Role Actions.
<P>
Here's an example to help explain how this works.
Suppose you have a role with nickname &quot;role1&quot; and role1 has
(among other things)
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Reply-To = The Pres &lt;president@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
set.
If in &quot;role2&quot; you set &quot;Initialize settings using role&quot; to
&quot;role1&quot;, then role2 will inherit the Set Reply-To value
from role1 by default (and any of the other inheritable action values
that are set).
So if role2 had
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Reply-To = &lt;No Value Set&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
defined, the Reply-To used with role2 would be &quot;The Pres &lt;president@example.com&gt;&quot;
However, if role2 had
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Reply-To = VP &lt;vicepresident@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
defined, then the Reply-To used with role2 would be &quot;VP &lt;vicepresident@example.com&gt;&quot; instead.
<P>
If you wish,
you may choose a nickname from your list of roles by using the
&quot;T&quot; command.
If the role you are using to initialize also has a role it initializes from,
then that initialization happens first.
That is, inheritance works as expected with the grandparent and
great-grandparent (and so on) roles having the expected effect.

For example, if you are Replying to a message there will already be at
least one address in the To header (the address you are Replying to).
However, if you Reply using a role which sets the To header, that role's
To header value will be used instead.
<P>
Because commas are used in the configuration file to separate the
list of Other Hdrs, you need to quote the value if that value
contains a comma.
Use double quotes and place the quotes around the entire value part of
the header, not including the name of the header.
For example, you might have
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Organization: &quot;My Organization Name, My City&quot;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
as one of the Other Hdrs.

<H1>Set Literal Signature Explained</H1>

This describes part of the action to be taken if the Pattern for this
role is a match.
This field contains the actual text for your signature, as opposed to
the name of a file containing your signature.
If this is defined it takes precedence over any value set in the
&quot;Set Signature&quot; field.
<P>
This is simply a different way to store the signature.
The signature is stored inside your Pine configuration file instead of in
a separate file.
Tokens work the same way they do with
<A HREF="h_config_role_setsig">Set Signature</A>, so refer to the
help text there for more information.
<P>

The two character sequence &#92;n (backslash followed by
the character n) will be used to signify a line-break in your signature.
You don't have to enter the &#92;n, but it will be visible in the
CHANGE THIS ROLE RULE window after you are done editing the signature.

This describes part of the action to be taken if the Pattern for this
role is a match.
<P>
If either the default <A HREF="h_config_literal_sig">Literal-Signature</A>
option from Setup/Config
or the &quot;Set LiteralSig&quot; option for this role are defined,
then this option will be ignored.
You can tell that that is the case because the value of this
option will show up as
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&lt;Ignored: using LiteralSig instead&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You may either use all Literal Signatures (signatures stored in your
configuration file) throughout Pine, or all signature files.
You can't mix the two.
<P>
This field consists of a filename which will be used as the signature
file when using this role.
<P>
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead
of reading the contents of the file the file is assumed to be a
program which will produce the text to be used on its standard output.
The program can't have any arguments and doesn't receive any input from Pine,
but the rest of the processing works as if the contents came from a file.
<P>
Instead of storing the data in a local file, the
signature data may be stored remotely in an IMAP folder.
In order to do this, 
you must use a remote name for the signature.
A remote signature name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/sig3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The syntax used here is the same as the syntax used for a remote
<A HREF="h_config_signature_file">Signature-File</A>.
Note that you may not access an existing signature file remotely,
you have to create a new <EM>folder</EM> which contains the signature data.
If the name you use here for the signature data is a remote name, then when
you edit the file using the &quot;F&quot; command the data will
be saved remotely in the folder.
You aren't required to do anything special to create the folder, it
gets created if you use a remote name.

<P>
If you type &quot;F&quot; you may edit the contents of the file (as opposed to
the name of the file) you have specified.
If you type &quot;T&quot; you may use a browser to choose an existing filename.
<P>
Besides containing regular text, a signature file may also
contain (or a signature program may produce) tokens which are replaced with text
which depends on the message you are replying to or forwarding.
The tokens all look like _word_ (a word surrounded by underscores).
For example, if the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is included in the text of the signature file, then when you reply to
or forward a message, the token will be replaced with the actual date
the message you are replying to or forwarding was sent.
<P>
If you use a role which has a signature file for a plain composition
(that is, not a reply or forward) then there is no original message, so
any tokens which depend on the message will be replaced with nothing.
So if you want a signature file to be useful for new compositions it
shouldn't include any of the tokens which depend on the message being
replied to or forwarded.
<P>
The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.
<P>
Actually, for the adventurous, there is a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
It's explained in detail
<A HREF="h_reply_token_conditionals">here</A>.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token in
a signature file, you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example, to include the literal text _DATE_ you must actually use
&#92;_DATE_.
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>
A blank field here means that Pine will use its normal rules for deciding
which file (if any) to use for the signature file.
<P>
An alternate method for storing the signature is available in
<A HREF="h_config_role_setlitsig">Set Literal Signature</A>.

The template file is a file which is included at the top of the message you
are composing.
<P>
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead

You should not use this option unless you are prepared to have matching
messages expunged from the folder permanently.
For example, if you type the Expunge command, this filter is applied
before the expunge, so matching messages will be marked Deleted and then
will be permanently expunged from the folder.
However, since the index isn't redrawn in between the time that the message
is marked Deleted and the time that you are asked to expunge, the only
indication that you are expunging the message comes in the number of messages
being expunged.
The same thing may happen when you close a folder.
It is also possible that an expunge not initiated by you will
delete matching messages.

the past week, the day of the week and the hour are used
(e.g. &quot;Wed09am&quot;, &quot;Thu10pm&quot;); other dates are
given as date, month, and year (e.g. &quot;23Aug00&quot;,
&quot;9Apr98&quot;).

<DT>MSGNO</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the message's current position in the folder which,
of course, may change as the folder is sorted or new mail arrives.
</DD>

<DT>STATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents a three character wide field displaying various
aspects of the message's state.
The first character is either blank,
a '*' for message marked Important, or a '+' indicating a message
addressed directly to you (as opposed to your having received it via a
mailing list, for example).
When the feature
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_mark_for_cc">Mark-For-CC</A>&quot;
is set, if the first character would have been
blank then it will instead be a '-' if the message is cc'd to you.
The second character is typically blank,
though the arrow cursor may occupy it if either the 
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_force_low_speed">Assume-Slow-Link</A>&quot;
or the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_force_arrow">Force-Arrow-Cursor</A>&quot; feature
is set (or you actually are on a slow link).
The third character is either '<A HREF="h_flag_deleted">D</A>' (Deleted),
'<A HREF="h_flag_answered">A</A>' (Answered),
'<A HREF="h_flag_new">N</A>' (New), or blank.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then this token refers to all of the messages in the collapsed portion of
the thread instead of just the top message.
The first character will be a '*' if <EM>any</EM> of the messages in the thread
are marked Important, else a '+' if any of the messages are addressed
to you, else a '-' if any of the messages are cc'd to you.
The third character will be a 'D' if <EM>all</EM> of the messages
in the collapsed thread are marked deleted, else it will be 'N' if any of
the messages are undeleted and unseen, and it will be blank otherwise.
</DD>

<DT>FULLSTATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents a less abbreviated alternative
to the &quot;STATUS&quot; token.
It is six characters wide.
The first character is '+', '-', or blank, the
second blank, the third either '*' or blank, the fourth
'<A HREF="h_flag_new">N</A>' or blank,
the fifth '<A HREF="h_flag_answered">A</A>'
or blank, and the sixth character is
either '<A HREF="h_flag_deleted">D</A>' or
blank.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then this token refers to all of the messages in the collapsed portion of
the thread instead of just the top message.
The first character is '+', '-', or blank depending on whether <EM>any</EM>
of the messages in the collapsed thread are addressed to you or cc'd to you.
The third character will be '*' if any of the messages are marked
Important.
The fourth character will be 'N' if all of the messages in the thread
are New, else 'n' if some of the messages in the thread are New, else blank.
The fifth character will be 'A' or 'a' or blank, and the sixth character
will be 'D' or 'd' or blank.
</DD>

<DT>IMAPSTATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents an even less abbreviated alternative to the
&quot;STATUS&quot; token.
It differs from &quot;FULLSTATUS&quot; in only the fourth character which is
an 'N' if the message is new to this folder since the last time
it was opened <EM>and</EM> it has not been viewed, an 'R' (Recent) if the message
is new to the folder and has been viewed, a 'U' (Unseen) if the message is not 
new to the folder since it was last opened <EM>but</EM> has not been
viewed, or a blank if the message has been in the folder since it was
last opened and has been viewed.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then the fourth character will be
'N' if all of the messages in the thread are unseen and recent;
else 'n' if some of the messages in the thread are unseen and recent;
else 'U' if all of the messages in the thread are unseen and not recent;
else 'u' if some of the messages in the thread are unseen and not recent;
else 'R' if all of the messages in the thread are seen and recent;
else 'r' if some of the messages in the thread are seen and recent;
else blank.
</DD>

<DT>SIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes (rounded to the nearest 1,000).
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
Commas are not used in this field.
This field is seven characters wide, including the enclosing parentheses.
Sizes are rounded when &quot;K&quot; or &quot;M&quot; is present.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 9999 10K ... 999K 1.0M ... 99.9M 100M ... 2000M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>SIZECOMMA</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes (rounded to the nearest 1,000).
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
Commas are used if the number shown is 1,000 or greater.
The SIZECOMMA field is one character wider than the SIZE field.
Sizes are rounded when &quot;K&quot; or &quot;M&quot; is present.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 99,999 100K ... 9,999K 10.0M ... 999.9M 1,000M ... 2,000M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>KSIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size of the message, expressed in
kilobytes or megabytes, as most appropriate.
These are 1,024 byte kilobytes and 1,024 x 1,024 byte megabytes.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0K 1K ... 1023K 1.0M ... 99.9M 100M ... 2047M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>SIZENARROW</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes.
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
If a &quot;G&quot; (Gigabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000,000 times that many bytes.
This field uses only five characters of screen width, including the enclosing
parentheses.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 999 1K ... 99K .1M ... .9M 1M ... 99M .1G ... .9G 1G 2G</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>DESCRIPSIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token is intended to represent a more useful description of the
message than just its size, but it isn't very useful at this point.
The plus sign in this view means there are attachments.
Note that including this token in
the &quot;Index-Format&quot; could slow down the
display a little while Pine collects the necessary information.
</DD>

<DT>SUBJKEY</DT>
<DD>
This token is the same as the SUBJECT token unless keywords are set for
the message.
In that case, a list of keywords enclosed in braces will be prepended to
the subject of the message.
Having this set in the Index-Format will also cause the keywords to be
prepended to the subject in the MESSAGE VIEW screen.
If you have given a keyword a nickname
(<A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A>), that nickname is displayed
instead of the actual keyword.
The <A HREF="h_config_kw_braces">Keyword-Surrounding-Chars</A>
option may be used to modify this token slightly.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
</DD>

<DT>SUBJKEYINIT</DT>
<DD>
This token is the same as the SUBJKEY token except that instead of
prepending a list of keywords to the subject, a list of first initials
of keywords will be prepended instead.
For example, if a message has the keywords <EM>Work</EM> and <EM>Now</EM>
set (or Work and Now are the Pine nicknames of keywords which are set)
then the SUBJKEY token would cause a result like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{Work Now} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
whereas the SUBJKEYINIT token would give
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{WN} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The <A HREF="h_config_kw_braces">Keyword-Surrounding-Chars</A>
option may be used to modify this token slightly.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
</DD>

<DT>KEY</DT>
<DD>
This is a space-delimited list of keywords that are set for the message.
If you have given a keyword a nickname
(<A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A>), that nickname is displayed
instead of the actual keyword.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
</DD>

<DT>KEYINIT</DT>
<DD>
This is a list of keyword initials that are set for the message.
If you have given a keyword a nickname
(<A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A>), the initial of that nickname
is displayed instead of the initial of the actual keyword.
It is also possible to color keyword initials in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
</DD>

<DT>ATT</DT>
<DD>
This is a one column wide field which represents the number of attachments
a message has. It will be blank if there are no attachments, a single
digit for one to nine attachments, or an asterisk for more than nine.
Note that including this token in
the &quot;Index-Format&quot; could slow down the
display a little while Pine collects the necessary information.
</DD>

<DT>FROMORTO</DT>
<DD>
This token represents <EM>either</EM> the personal name (or email address) of
the person listed in the message's &quot;From:&quot; header
field, <EM>or</EM>, if that address is yours or one of your
<A HREF="h_config_alt_addresses">alternate addresses</A>,
the first person specified in the
message's &quot;To:&quot; header field
with the prefix &quot;To: &quot; prepended.
If the from address is yours and there is also no &quot;To&quot; address,
Pine will use the address on the &quot;Cc&quot; line.
If there is no address there, either, Pine will look for a newsgroup name
from the &quot;Newsgroups&quot; header field and put
that after the &quot;To: &quot; prefix.
</DD>

<DT>FROMORTONOTNEWS</DT>
<DD>
This is almost the same as <EM>FROMORTO</EM>.
The difference is that newsgroups aren't considered.
When a message is from you, doesn't have a To or Cc, and does have
a Newsgroups header; this token will be your name instead of the name
of the newsgroup (like it would be with FROMORTO).
</DD>

<DT>ARROW</DT>
<DD>
This gives an alternative way to display the current message in the
MESSAGE INDEX screen.
Usually the current message is indicated by the line being shown in
reverse video.
Instead, if the ARROW token is included in your Index-Format,
the current line will include an &quot;arrow&quot; that
looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>-&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
in the ARROW token's field.
For all of the non-current messages, the ARROW field will be filled
with blanks.
If you use the fixed-field width feature the length of the &quot;arrow&quot;
may be adjusted.
The arrow will be drawn as width-1 dashes followed by a greater than sign.
For example, if you use ARROW(3) you will get
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>--&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and ARROW(1) will give you just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is also possible to set the color of the ARROW field.
By default (and for non-current messages) the arrow is colored the same
as the index line it is part of.
You may set it to be another color with the 
<A HREF="h_config_arrow_color">Index Arrow Color</A> option available from
the <A HREF="h_color_setup">Setup Kolor</A> screen.
</DD>

<DT>SCORE</DT>
<DD>
This gives the
<a href="h_rules_score">score</a>
of each message.
This will be six columns wide to accomodate the widest possible score.
You will probably want to use the Index-Format fixed-field width feature
to limit the width of the field to the widest score that
you use (e.g. SCORE(3) if your scores are always between 0 and 999).
If you have not defined any score rules the scores will all be zero.
If any of your score rules contain AllText or BodyText patterns
then including SCORE in the Index-Format
may slow down the display of the MESSAGE INDEX screen.

<DT>CURSORPOS</DT>
<DD>
This token is different from the others.
When it is replaced it is replaced with nothing, but it sets a Pine
internal variable which tells the composer to start with the cursor
positioned at the position where this token was.
If both the template file and the signature file contain
a &quot;CURSORPOS&quot; token, then the position in the template file
is used.
If there is a template file and neither it nor the signature file contains
a &quot;CURSORPOS&quot; token, then the cursor is positioned
after the end of the contents of the
template file when the composer starts up.

It may <EM>not</EM> be used with the
<A HREF="h_config_index_format">&quot;Index-Format&quot;</A> option.

<P>
There is a limited if-else capability for including text.
The if-else condition is based
on whether or not a given token would result in replacement text you
specify.
The syntax of this conditional inclusion is
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_token_(match_this, if_matched [ , if_not_matched ] )</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The left parenthesis must follow the underscore immediately, with no
intervening space.
It means the token is expanded and the results of that expansion are
compared against the &quot;match_this&quot; argument.
If there is an exact match, then the &quot;if_matched&quot; text is used
as the replacement text.
Otherwise, the &quot;if_not_matched&quot; text is used.
One of the most useful values for the &quot;match_this&quot; argument is
the empty string, &quot;&quot;.
In that case the expansion is compared against the empty string.
<P>
Here's an example to make it clearer.
This text could be included in one of your template files:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_NEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;I'm replying to email&quot;, &quot;I'm replying to news&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If that is included in a template file which you are using while replying
to a message (because you chose to use the role it was part of),
and that message has a newsgroup header and a newsgroup in that header,
then the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>I'm replying to news</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will be included in the message you are about to compose.
On the other hand, if the message you are replying to does not have
a newsgroup, then the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>I'm replying to email</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would be included instead.
This would also work in signature files and in
the &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot; option.
If the &quot;match_this&quot;, &quot;if_matched&quot;,
or &quot;if_not_matched&quot; arguments contain
spaces, parentheses, or commas;
they have to be quoted with double quotation marks (like in the example
above).
If you want to include a literal quote (&quot;) in the text you must escape the
quote by preceding it with a backslash (&#92;) character.
If you want to include a literal backslash character you must escape it
by preceding it with another backslash.
<P>
The comma followed by &quot;if_not_matched&quot; is optional.
If there is no &quot;if_not_matched&quot;
present then no text is included if the not_matched case is true.
Here's another example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_NEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;This msg was seen in group: _NEWS_.&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Here you can see that tokens may appear in the arguments.
The same is true for tokens with the conditional parentheses.
They may appear in arguments,
though you do have to be careful to get the quoting and escaping of
nested double quotes correct.
If this was in the signature file being used and you were replying to a message
sent to comp.mail.pine the resulting text would be:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>This msg was seen in group: comp.mail.pine.</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you were replying to a message which wasn't sent to any newsgroup the
resulting text would be a single blank line.
The reason you'd get a blank line is because the end of the line is
outside of the conditional, so is always included.
If you wanted to get rid of that blank line you could do so by moving
the end of line inside the conditional.
In other words, it's ok to have multi-line
&quot;if_matched&quot; or &quot;if_not_matched&quot; arguments in your
template file.
The text just continues until the next double quotation, even if it's not
on the same line.
<P>
Here's an example for use in the &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot;:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM__CURNEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;seen in _CURNEWS_,&quot;) wrote</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If this was in your Reply-Leadin and you were replying to a message
while reading the newsgroup comp.mail.pine the resulting text would be:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On Sat, 24 Oct 1998, Fred Flintstone, seen in comp.mail.pine, wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you were replying to a message while reading an email folder instead
of a newsgroup the resulting leadin text would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On Sat, 24 Oct 1998, Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Here's one more (contrived) example illustrating a matching argument
which is not the empty string.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_SMARTDATE_("Today", _SMARTDATE_, "On _DATE_") _FROM_ wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If this was the value of your &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot; option and you
were replying to
a message which was sent today, then the value of the &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot;
would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Today Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
But if you were replying to a message sent on Oct. 27 (and that wasn't
today) you would get

<TITLE>Server Name Syntax</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Server Name Syntax</H1>

This help describes the syntax which may be used for server names
which may be associated with remote folders or SMTP servers.

<P>
A server name is the hostname of the server.
It's a good idea to use the host's fully-qualified network name.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>foo.example.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

However, IP addresses are allowed if surrounded
with square-brackets.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[127.0.0.1]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

An optional network port number may be supplied by appending
a colon (:) followed by the port number
to the server name.
By default, the IMAP port number, 143, is used.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>foo.example.com:port</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Besides server name and optional port number, various other optional
parameters may be supplied that alter Pine's interaction with the server.
A parameter is supplied by appending a slash (/) character followed by
the parameter's name and,
depending on the particular parameter, the value assigned to that
name, to the server name (and optional port number).
Parameter names are <EM>not</EM> case sensitive.
Currently supported parameters include:

<DL>

<DT>User</DT>
<DD>This parameter requires an associated value, and is intended to
provide the username identifier with which to establish the server
connection.
If your SMTP server offers SMTP AUTH authentication, adding this 
parameter to the
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;SMTP-Server&quot;</A>
option will cause Pine to attempt to authenticate to the server using the
supplied username.
Similarly, if your NNTP server offers NNTP &quot;AUTHINFO SASL&quot;
or &quot;AUTHINFO USER&quot; authentication, adding this parameter to the
<A HREF="h_config_nntp_server">NNTP-Server</A>
option (or to the server name for any folder collection using NNTP)
will cause Pine to attempt
to authenticate to the server using the supplied username.
An example might be:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/user=katie</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>TLS</DT>
<DD>
Normally, when a new connection is made an attempt is made to 
negotiate a secure (encrypted) session using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
If that fails then a non-encrypted connection will be attempted instead.
This is a unary parameter indicating communication with the server must 
take place over a TLS connection. If the attempt to use TLS fails then
this parameter will cause the connection to fail instead of falling
back to an insecure connection.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/tls</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>SSL</DT>
<DD>
This is a unary parameter indicating communication with the server should 
take place over a Secure Socket Layer connection.  The server must support
this method, and be prepared to accept connections on the appropriate
port (993 by default).
Pine must be linked with an SSL library for this option to be operational.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/ssl</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>NoValidate-Cert</DT>
<DD>Do not validate certificates (for TLS or SSL connections) from the server.
This is needed if the server uses self-signed certificates or if Pine
cannot validate the certificate for some other known reason.
<P>
</DD>

<DT>Anonymous</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter (that means it does not have a value)
indicating that the connection be logged in as
&quot;anonymous&quot; rather than a specific user.
Not all servers offer anonymous
access; those which do generally only offer read-only access to certain
&quot;public&quot; folders.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/anonymous</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>Secure</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter indicating that the connection use the
most secure authentication method mutually supported by Pine and the
server.
Pine is capable of authenticating connections to 
the server using several methods.
By default, Pine will attempt each
method until either a connection is established or the
list of methods is exhausted.
This parameter causes Pine to instead fail 
the connection if the first (generally most &quot;secure&quot;) method fails.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/secure</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>Submit</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter for use with the
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;SMTP-Server&quot;</A> option.
It indicates that the connection should be made to the Submit server
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt">RFC 3676</A>)
(port 587) instead of the SMTP port (25).
At the time this help was written the submit option was equivalent to
specifying port 587.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/submit</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>host:587</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

</DD>

<DT>Debug</DT>
<DD>This is a unary parameter indicating that the connection be established
in a verbose mode.  Basically, it causes Pine to log the communication with
the server in Pine's debug file.
Normally, the pine -d command-line flag would be used instead.
<P>
</DD>

<DT>NoRsh</DT>
<DD>By default, Pine attempts to login using &quot;rsh&quot;,
the UNIX remote shell program.
Including &quot;NoRsh&quot; will cause connections to this server to skip
the &quot;rsh&quot; attempt.
This might be useful to avoid long timeouts caused by rsh firewalls, for
example.
<P>
</DD>

<DT>Service</DT>
<DD>This parameter requires an associated value.  The default value is
&quot;IMAP&quot; which indicates communication with the server based
on the IMAP4rev1 protocol (defined in RFC 3501 -- see 
<A HREF="http://www.imap.org/docs/rfc3501.html">http://www.imap.org/docs/rfc3501.html</A>).</DD>

Other service values include:
 <DL>
 <DT>NNTP</DT>
 <DD>This value indicates communication with the server takes place via
the Network News Transfer Protocol.  Use this to define a collection
of newsgroups on a remote news server.  So

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/service=NNTP</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/NNTP</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

is the way to specify NNTP access.
<P>
 </DD>

 <DT>POP3</DT>
 <DD>This value indicates communication with the server takes place via the
Post Office Protocol 3 protocol.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/service=POP3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/POP3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Note that there are several important issues
to consider when selecting this option:
<OL>
 <LI> POP3 provides access to only your INBOX.  In other words,
secondary folders such as your &quot;saved-messages&quot; are inaccessible.
 <LI> Pine's implementation of POP3 does not follow the traditional POP
model and will leave your mail on the server. Refer to the
<A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A> functionality for a possible way around this problem.
 <LI> See the discussion about new-mail checking in <A HREF="h_config_reopen_rule">&quot;Folder-Reopen-Rule&quot;</A>.
</OL>
</DD>
</DL>

<DT>Loser</DT>
<DD>This is intended for use with defective servers that do not implement the
protocol specification correctly.
It should be used only as a last resort since it is likely that it
will seriously degrade performance.
Setting this parameter will cause Pine to disable various protocol features
and perform client-side workarounds instead.
For example, it disables the IMAP SEARCH, SORT, and THREAD commands
and does client-side searching, sorting, and threading instead.
If set for the <A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;SMTP-Server&quot;</A>
option, it causes Pine to not use the EHLO command and so not
to attempt to use any SMTP extensions.
The precise measures taken when &quot;loser&quot; is set depend on the
protocol and are subject to change over time.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>/loser</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Note that it is possible to include more than one parameter in a server
specification by concatenating the parameters. For example:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>foo.example.com:port/user=katie/novalidate-cert/debug</SAMP></CENTER>

<H1>Collection Edit Help -- Server Field</H1>

This collection's &quot;Server:&quot; definition indicates the
hostname of the server providing access to the folders in this

The syntax of this server name is the same as for other server names used

<TITLE>Collection Path: Explained</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>Collection Edit Help -- Path Field</H1>

The collection's &quot;Path:&quot; definition indicates the location
of the folders in this collection.  If the path or any of its components
do not exist, Pine will prompt you for their creation when exiting the
Add/Change screen.

<P> 
By default the path is interpreted as defining a section of your personal
folder area.  This area and how you specify it are defined by the
server, if one is specified in the collection, or, typically, the home
directory if no server is defined.

<P>
To define a collection outside the default &quot;area&quot;, prefix
the path with the &quot;namespace&quot; to use when interpreting the
given path.  If a namespace is specified, the Path begins with the
sharp, &quot;#&quot;, character followed by the name of the namespace
and then the namespace's path-element-delimiter.  Aside from the
path's format, namespaces can also imply access rights, content
policy, audience, location, and, occasionally, access methods.

<P>
Each server exports its own set (possibly of size one) of 
namespaces.  Hence, it's likely communication with your server's
administrator will be required for specific configurations.  Some of
the more common namespaces, however, include:

<DL>
<DT>#news.</DT>
<DD>This specifies a set of folders in the newsgroup namespace.  Newsgroup
names are hierarchically defined with each level delimited by a period.
</DD>
<DT>#public/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the server may export to the general
public.
</DD>
<DT>#shared/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that the folder may export to groups
of users.
</DD>
<DT>#ftp/</DT>
<DD>This specifies a folder area that is the same as that it may have 
exported via the &quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;.
</DD>
<DT>#mh/</DT>
<DD>This specifies the personal folder area associated with folders
and directories that were created using the MH message handling system.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>

In addition, the server may support access to other user's folders,
provided you have suitable permissions.  Common methods use a prefix
of either &quot;~<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot;, or &quot;/<VAR>user</VAR>/&quot; to
indicate the root of the other user's folder area.

<H1>Collection Edit Help -- View Field</H1>

The collection's &quot;View:&quot; definition provides a way to limit
the displayed list of folders within a collection.  By default, only
folders that contain the specified characters anywhere in their name
are shown in the collection's folder list.

<P>
Additionally, you can use a wildcard character to better control
the list of folders selected for display.  The wildcard specifier is
the star, &quot;*&quot;, character.

<P>
So, for example, to define a collection of all folders ending with
&quot;c&quot;, you'd specify a view of &quot;*c&quot; (without the
quote characters!).  Or, similarly, to define a collection of folders
whose names start with &quot;a&quot; and end with &quot;z&quot;, you'd
specify a view of &quot;a*z&quot;.

Note that if an attribute isn't present at all, then the match will fail.
For example, if a server doesn't support the Locality attribute, then no

This field may be set to the string representation of an LDAP search
filter (see RFC1960). Here are some examples:

To search for an entry with a surname equal to "clinton" you could set
the custom filter to:

     (sn=clinton)
    
This is equivalent to putting "clinton" in the SurName field.
To search for an entry which has a surname which begins with "clint" and
has a givenname equal to "william" you could use:

     (&(sn=clint*)(givenname=william))
    
This is equivalent to setting the SurName field to "clint*" and the
GivenName field to "william".
To search for an entry where either the common name OR the email address
contains "abcde" you could use:

     (|(cn=*abcde*)(mail=*abcde*))

That isn't equivalent to anything you can do by setting the other fields
because of the OR.

<H1>INTERNET EMAIL ADDRESS FORMAT</H1>

A valid email address on the Internet has a username, an &quot;@&quot; sign,

For example, jsmith@art.example.com might be the email address
of a person  
with the username &quot;jsmith&quot; who has an account in the domain
&quot;art.example.com&quot;.  The number of dot-separated segments on the 
right of the &quot;@&quot; sign can vary - a shorter example would be 
isabelle@elsewhere.edu (the shortest possible form: here, only the 
organization's domain is specified after the &quot;@&quot; sign); a longer 
example would be

edutech.example.com is also specified).  
<P>  
If you do not know the exact email address of someone you want to write 
to, ask them what it is using other means of communication than email; or 
use the tools for 
finding people's addresses that are available on the Internet.  See, 
for example, the World Wide Web site:
<P>
<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/nic/addresses">http://www.washington.edu/nic/addresses</A></CENTER>
<P>
If you are sending to someone on the same system as you are, you can leave
the &quot;@&quot; sign and all the information to its right off of the 
address, and Pine will fill it in automatically, 
unless the feature 
<A HREF="h_config_compose_rejects_unqual">&quot;Compose-Rejects-Unqualified-Addrs&quot;</A> is set in SETUP CONFIGURATION.  Sometimes you can also
abbreviate the right part of the address if you are at the same domain.<P>

When an email address you send a message to is not reachable -- either because 
it is simply an incorrect address, or because email can temporarily not be 
delivered to it due to a technical problem on the way to or at the recipient's 
end -- you will almost always get an error notification email message back.
<P>
If you encounter problems with, or have questions about, email delivery or
email address syntax, contact your local network computing consultants.

<h1>OPTION: Pruned-folders</h1>

This variable allows you to define a list of one or more folders that
Pine will offer to prune for you in the same way it automatically offers
to prune your "sent-mail" folder each month.
Each folder in this list must be a folder in your default folder collection
(the first folder collection if you have more than one), and it is just
the relative name of the folder in the collection, not the fully-qualified name.
It is similar to sent-mail.
Instead of something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Pruned-Folders={servername}mail/folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
the correct value to use would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
There is an assumption here that your first collection is the folders in
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{servername}mail</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Once a month, for each folder listed, Pine will offer to move
the contents of the folder to a new folder of the same name but with
the previous month's date appended.  Pine will then look for any such
date-appended folder names created for a previous month, and offer each
one it finds for deletion.
<P>

If you decline the first offer, no mail is moved and no new folder is
created.
<P>

The new folders will be created
in your default folder collection.

<H1>OPTION: Upload-Command</H1>
 
This option affects the behavior of the Composer's &quot;Read File&quot; 
(^R in the message body) and &quot;Attach File&quot; (^J in the header) 
commands.  It specifies
a Unix program name, and any necessary command line arguments, that Pine can
use to transfer files from your personal computer into messages that you are
composing.<P>

<B>Note:</B> this facility is intended for use with serial line transfer 
protocols, such as kermit, xmodem, or zmodem.  It is <B>not</B> intended
to work with TCP/IP file transfer programs such as ftp.<P>

If a program is specified, the commands listed above are modified to offer a
subcommand (^Y) to activate the transfer.  Obviously, the Unix program
specified here must match the transfer program or protocol available on the
personal computer.<P>

Pine expects to exchange uploaded data via a file on your Unix system.  When
the specified upload program finishes, Pine expects the uploaded data to be
contained in this file.<P>

When upload is invoked via the &quot;Read File&quot; subcommand, Pine 
generates a
temporary file name that it will pass to the specified Unix program.  Pine
will read the resulting uploaded text from this file and then delete it when
the upload command is finished.<P>

When upload is invoked via the &quot;Attach File&quot; subcommand, Pine will 
prompt
you for the name of the file that is to contain the uploaded information that
it is to attach.  Pine will attach this file to the composition, but will
<B>not</B> delete this file after the upload command is finished.<P>

The special token &quot;_FILE_&quot; may be included among the Unix program's 
command
line arguments.  Pine will replace this symbol with the name of the file
being used to exchange the uploaded information.  This token allows you to
position the file name where it is required in the Unix program's command
line arguments.<P>

If the &quot;_FILE_&quot; token is not present in the specified command, the
temporary file's name is automatically appended to the specified Unix
program.  In other words, you don't need to use &quot;_FILE_&quot; if it is the

transfer the exported message to your personal computer's disk.<P>
Note: this facility is intended for use with serial line transfer 
protocols, such as kermit, xmodem, or zmodem.  It is <B>not</B> intended
to work with TCP/IP file transfer programs such as ftp.<P>
If a program is specified, the Export command is modified to offer a
subcommand (^V) to activate the transfer (in lieu of saving it to
 the machine where Pine is running).  Obviously, the Unix program
specified here must match the transfer program or protocol available on the
personal computer.<P>

When this subcommand is selected and before Pine invokes the specified Unix
program, Pine will create a temporary file containing the text of the
exported message.  Pine uses this file to pass the exported message text to
the specified Unix program.<P>

The special token &quot;_FILE_&quot; may be included among the Unix program's command
line arguments.  Pine will replace this symbol with the temporary file's name
before executing the Unix program.  This token allows you to position the
file name where it is required in the Unix program's command line arguments.

If the &quot;_FILE_&quot; token is not present in the specified command, the

This value specifies the name of one or more SMTP 
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) servers for sending mail. 
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
You must have an SMTP server for use with PC-Pine.
SMTP servers are
normally set up by a system administrator for use by all members of a given
campus or department.
Contact your local help desk to ask what SMTP
servers you should use.  
<!--chtml else-->
Unix Pine users may not need to set an SMTP server.
Pine will attempt to execute the program (usually sendmail) that is used
to insert mail into the mail system.
If this works for you, you may leave this option blank.
If there is an SMTP server running on the Unix host you may be able to
improve sending performance slightly by setting the SMTP server option
to &quot;localhost&quot; or to the actual name of the Unix host.
<P>
If the Unix host doesn't work the way Pine was expecting you will need to
set the value of this option.
SMTP servers are
normally set up by a system administrator for use by all members of a given
campus or department.
Contact your local help desk to ask what SMTP
servers you should use.  
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>
Your SMTP server may offer SMTP AUTH authentication.
It may even require it.
If your SMTP server offers SMTP AUTH authentication you may specify a
&quot;user&quot; name parameter to cause Pine to attempt to authenticate.
This parameter requires an associated value,
the username identifier with which to establish the server
connection.
An example might be:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com/user=katie</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

If AUTH authentication is offered by the server, this will cause Pine to
attempt to use it.
If AUTH authentication is not offered by the server, this will cause Pine
to fail sending with an error similar to:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Error: SMTP authentication not available</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Another type of authentication that is used by some ISPs is called
&quot;POP before SMTP&quot; or &quot;IMAP before SMTP&quot;,
which means that you have to authenticate
yourself to the POP or IMAP server by opening a mailbox before you
can send mail.
To do this, you usually only have to open your INBOX.

<P>
You may tell Pine to use the
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt">Message Submission</A>
port (587) instead of the SMTP port (25) by including the &quot;submit&quot;
parameter
in this option.
At this time &quot;/submit&quot; is simply equivalent to specifying
port 587, though it may imply more than that at some point in the future.
Some ISPs are blocking port 25 in order to reduce the amount of spam
being sent to their users.
You may find that the submit option allows you to get around such a block.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com/submit</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

To specify any non-standard port number on the SMTP server you may follow
the hostname with a colon followed by the portnumber.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com:12345</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Normally, when a connection is made to the Smtp-Server Pine will attempt
to negotiate a secure (encrypted) session using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
If that fails then a non-encrypted connection will be attempted instead.
You may specify that a TLS connection is required if you wish.
If you append &quot;/tls&quot; to the name then the connection will fail
instead of falling back to a non-secure connection.

<H1>OPTION: NNTP-Server</H1>

This value specifies the name of one or more NNTP
(Network News Transfer Protocol)
servers for reading and posting USENET news.
NNTP servers are normally
set up by a system administrator for use by all members of a given campus
or department.
Contact your local help desk to ask what NNTP servers you should use.  
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"--><!--chtml else-->
Often Unix Pine users will find that this variable has been
set for the whole system (and they don't have to worry about it).  
<!--chtml endif-->
When you define an NNTP server here, Pine implicitly defines a news
collection for you, assuming that server as the news server and assuming
that you will use the NNTP protocol and a local newsrc configuration file
for reading news.
For more about reading news with Pine, see
<A HREF="h_reading_news">how to use Pine to read news</A>.
<P>
Your NNTP server may offer NNTP &quot;AUTHINFO SASL&quot;
or &quot;AUTHINFO USER&quot; authentication.
It may even require it.
If your NNTP server does offer such authentication you may specify a user name
parameter to cause Pine to attempt to authenticate.
The same is true for the server name in a folder collection which uses NNTP.
This parameter requires an associated value,
the username identifier with which to establish the server connection.
An example might be:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>nntpserver.example.com/user=katie</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

If authentication is offered by the server, this will cause Pine to
attempt to use it.
If authentication is not offered by the server, this will cause Pine
to fail with an error similar to:

You may be able to specify an alternate INBOX which is either a local folder

A typical remote Inbox-Path entry would be: &#123;monet.art.example.com}INBOX
where &quot;monet.art.example.com&quot; is replaced by the name of your IMAP

<H1>How to Change your From Address</H1>

If the From address that Pine includes in mail that you send is not correct,
you may want to configure a different default value for the From address.
You may follow these directions to change the default:

<P>
<UL>
  <LI> Go to the Main Pine Menu
  <LI> From there type the Setup Command
  <LI> From there type the Config Command
</UL>

<P>
You've probably already seen this SETUP CONFIGURATION screen.
If not, there are many options you may want to set here.
To set the value of the From header you may use the
<A href="h_config_custom_hdrs">Customized-Hdrs</A> option.
Find it by scrolling down a few pages or use the WhereIs command to
search for &quot;customized&quot;.
You may want to read the help text associated with the option.
<P>
To add a custom From header, type the Add command and enter the
full header line, including the leading &quot;From:&nbsp;&quot;.
For example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>From: Full Name &lt;user@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Now exit the Setup command and try sending mail to yourself to see
what the From line looks like.
<P>
When you are in the composer you may edit the custom From line by typing
Ctrl-R while your cursor is in the headers of the message and then moving
to the From line and editing.
If you want to leave the default value the same but add the possibility
of being able to edit the header when you compose, add just the header
name without a value.
For example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>From:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you change your From address you may also find it useful to add the
changed From address to the
<a href="h_config_alt_addresses">Alt-Addresses</a>
configuration option.

By virtue of specifying a folder name here, Pine will be configured to
save all messages which you have read during a session into the designated
&quot;read messages&quot; folder.  This allows you to more easily distinguish
between your really new email (in your INBOX) and those which you have
already read.  Depending on how you define the 
<A HREF="h_config_auto_read_msgs">&quot;auto-move-read-messages&quot;</A>
setting, you may or may not be asked when you quit
Pine if you want read messages to be moved to this folder.  In either
case, moving the messages means they will be deleted from your INBOX.
<P>
If this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Form-Letter-Folder</H1>

A &quot;Form-Letter-Folder&quot; is a mail folder that is intended to
contain messages that you have composed and that are intended to be
sent in their original form repeatedly.

<P>
Setting this variable will alter Pine's usual behavior when you
execute the Compose command.  Normally, Pine offers a chance to
continue a postponed or interrupted message should one or the other
exist.  When this variable is set to a folder name that exists, Pine
will also offer the chance to select a message from the folder to
insert into the composer (much like when continuing a postponed message).
The difference, however, is that Pine will not automatically delete
the selected message from the Form Letter Folder.
<P>
Setting this variable will also affect Pine's behavior when you
Postpone a message from the composer.  Normally, Pine simply stashes
the message away in your
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_postponed_folder">Postponed-Folder</A>&quot;.
Regardless of the specified folder's existence, Pine will ask which
folder you intend the message to be stored in.  Choose the
&quot;F&quot; option to store the message in your Form Letter Folder.
This is the most common way to add a message to the folder.

<P>
Another method of adding messages to the folder is via the Pine
composer's <SAMP>Fcc:</SAMP> field.  If you are sending a message that
you expect to send in the same form again, you can enter the Form
Letter Folder's name in this field.  Pine, as usual, will copy the
message as it's sent.  Note, when you later select this message from 
your Form Letter Folder, it will have the same recipients as the original
message.

<P>
To delete a message from the Form Letter Folder, you can either select
the folder from a suitable FOLDER LIST screen, or use the Delete
command in the MESSAGE INDEX offered when selecting from the folder as
part of the Compose command.  You can delete a Form Letter Folder just
as any other folder from a suitable FOLDER LIST screen.

<P>
You may find that the <A HREF="h_rules_roles">&quot;Roles&quot;</A>
facility introduced in Pine 4.10 can be used
to replace the Form Letter Folder.

This is like
<A HREF="h_config_read_message_folder">Read-Message-Folder</A>,
only more general.  You may archive
any of the folders in your incoming collection.  This is a list of folder
pairs, with the first separated from the second in the pair by a space.
The first folder in a pair is the folder you want to archive, and the
second folder is the folder that read messages from the first should be
moved to.  Depending on how you define the
<A HREF="h_config_auto_read_msgs">&quot;auto-move-read-messages&quot;</A>
setting, you may or may not be asked when you
leave the first folder if you want read messages to be moved to the
second folder.  In either case, moving the messages means they will be
deleted from the first folder.
<P>
The name of the first folder in each pair can be either the technical
specification of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file)
or (much easier) the nickname that you gave the folder when you made it
an incoming folder.
<p>
For example:<p>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.example.com}inbox {monet.art.example.com}mail/inbox-archive</SAMP></CENTER>

With this option your actual signature, as opposed to
the name of a file containing your signature,
is stored in the Pine configuration file.
If this is defined it takes precedence over the Signature-File option.
<P>

This is simply a different way to store the signature.
The signature is stored inside your Pine configuration file instead of in
a separate file.
Tokens work the same way they do with the
<A HREF="h_config_signature_file">Signature-File</A> so look there for
help.
<P>

The Setup/Signature command on Pine's Main Menu will edit
the &quot;Literal-Signature&quot; by default.  However, if no
&quot;Literal-Signature&quot; is defined and the file named in the
&quot;Signature-File&quot; option exists, then the latter will be used
instead.
<P>

The two character sequence &#92;n (backslash followed by
the character n) will be used to signify a line-break in your signature.
You don't have to enter the &#92;n, but it will be visible in the
SETUP CONFIGURATION window after you are done editing the signature.

<H1>OPTION: Signature-File</H1>

If a <A HREF="h_config_literal_sig">Literal-Signature</A> option is defined,
then this &quot;Signature-File&quot; option will be ignored.
You can tell that that is the case because the value of the
&quot;Signature-File&quot; will show up as
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&lt;Ignored: using Literal-Signature instead&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You may either use all Literal Signatures (signatures stored in your
configuration file) throughout Pine, or all signature files.
You can't mix the two.
<P>
This is the name of a file which will be automatically inserted into
outgoing messages.
It typically contains information such as your
name, email address and organizational affiliation.
Pine adds the
signature into the message as soon as you enter the composer so you
can choose to remove it or edit it on a message by message basis.
Signature file placement in message replies is controlled by the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_sig_at_bottom">Signature-At-Bottom</A>&quot;
setting in the feature list.
<P>

The default file name is
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;PINE.SIG&quot; in the same directory as your PINERC file if your
PINERC file is a local file.
If your PINERC file is remote, then it will be in the directory specified
by the &quot;-aux local_directory&quot; command line option.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;.signature&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
<P>

To create or edit your signature file choose Setup from the Main Menu
and then select S for Signature (Main/Setup/Signature).  This puts you
into the Signature Editor where you can enter a <EM>few</EM> lines of
text containing your identity and affiliation.

<P>
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead
of reading the contents of the file the file is assumed to be a
program which will produce the text to be used on its standard output.
The program can't have any arguments and doesn't receive any input from Pine,
but the rest of the processing works as if the contents came from a file.

<P>
Instead of storing the data in a local file, the
signature data may be stored remotely in an IMAP folder.
In order to do this, 
you must use a remote name for the file.
A remote Signature-File name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/signature</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The syntax used here is the same as the syntax used for remote configuration
files from the command line.
Note that you may not access an existing signature file remotely,
you have to create a new <EM>folder</EM> which contains the signature data.
If the name you use here for the signature file is a remote name, then when
you edit the file from the Setup/Signature command the data will be stored
remotely in the folder.
You aren't required to do anything special to create the folder, it
gets created automatically if you use a remote name.

<P>
Besides regular text, the signature file may also contain
(or a signature program may produce) tokens which
are replaced with text which usually depends on the message you are replying
to or forwarding.
For example, if the signature file contains the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
anywhere in the text, then that token is replaced by the date
the message you are replying to or forwarding was sent.
If it contains
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_CURDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
that is replaced with the current date.
The first is an example of a token which depends on the message you
are replying to (or forwarding) and the second is an example which
doesn't depend on anything other than the current date.
You have to be a little careful with this facility since tokens which
depend on the message you are replying to or forwarding will be replaced
by nothing in the case where you are composing a new message from scratch.
The use of <A HREF="h_rules_roles">&quot;roles&quot;</A> may help you
in this respect.
It allows you to use different signature files in different cases.
<P>

The list of tokens available for use in the signature file is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.
<P>

Instead of, or along with the use of &quot;roles&quot; to give you
different signature files in different situations, there is also
a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
This is explained in detail
<A HREF="h_reply_token_conditionals">here</A>.
This isn't for the faint of heart.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token
in the signature you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#92;_DAYDATE_ = _DAYDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DAYDATE_ = Sat, 24 Oct 1998</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>
An alternate method for storing the signature data is available by using the
<A HREF="h_config_literal_sig">Literal-Signature</A> configuration option.
This variable will be used by default.

<H1>OPTION: Initial-Keystroke-List</H1>

The initial keystroke--or command--list option lets you start Pine at
any place you like.
Whatever keystrokes you specify here will be executed
by Pine upon startup as a macro.
The words SPACE, TAB, DOWN, UP, LEFT, and
RIGHT indicate the pressing of those keys.
CR indicates the pressing of the RETURN key.
F1 through F12 represent the function keys, and ^ followed
by a character indicates that key pressed along with the control key (in
other words, ^P means Ctrl-P).
As a shortcut notation, an element of the list may be several characters
surrounded by double-quotes (").
That will be expanded into the individual keystrokes
(excluding the double-quote characters).
For example, the quoted-string

<P><CENTER>"ABC"</CENTER>

<P>
is interpreted the same as the three separate list members

<P><CENTER>A and B and C</CENTER>

<P>
which is also the same as

<P><CENTER>A,B,C</CENTER>

<P>
An example: To view message 1 on startup,
you could use an Initial-Keystroke-List equal to

<P><CENTER>I,J,1,CR,V</CENTER>

<P>
An equivalent version of this is

<P><CENTER>"IJ1",CR,V</CENTER>

<P>
Restrictions: You cannot pre-type into the composer with the initial
keystroke list, and you cannot mix function key commands with letter
commands.

You may add your own custom headers to outgoing messages.
Each header you specify here must include the header tag 
(<A HREF="h_composer_reply_to">Reply-To:</A>, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.
If you want to see these custom headers each time you compose a message,
you must add them to your
<A HREF="h_config_comp_hdrs">Default-Composer-Headers</A> list, 
otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the
<A HREF="h_compose_richhdr">Rich Header</A>
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->(F5)
<!--chtml else-->(Ctrl-R)<!--chtml endif--> command.
(If you are looking for a way to change which headers are <EM>displayed</EM>
when you view a message, take a look at the
<A HREF="h_config_viewer_headers">Viewer-Hdrs</A>
option instead.)
Here's an example which shows how you might set your From address
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>From: Full Name &lt;user@example.com&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and another showing how you might set a Reply-To address
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Reply-To: user@example.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
You may also set non-standard header values here.
For example, you could add
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Organization: My Organization Name</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or even
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>X-Favorite-Colors: Purple and Gold</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you include a value after the colon then that header will be included
in your outgoing messages unless you delete it before sending.
If a header in the Customized-Hdrs list has only a tag but no value, then
it will not be included in outgoing messages unless you edit a value
in manually.
For example, if
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Reply-To:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is in the list, then the Reply-To header will be available for editing
but won't be included unless a value is added while in the composer.
<P>
It's actually a little more complicated than that.
The values of headers that you set with the Customized-Hdrs option are
defaults.
If the message you are about to compose already has a value for a header,
that value is used instead of a value from your Customized-Hdrs.
For example, if you are Replying to a message the Subject field
will already be filled in.
In that case, if the Customized-Hdrs list contains a Subject line, the
custom subject will <EM>NOT</EM> be used.
The subject derived from the subject of the message you are Replying
to will be used instead.
<P>
It is also possible to make header setting even more complicated and more
automatic by using
<A HREF="h_rules_roles">Roles</A>,
but if all you want to do is set a default value for a header, you don't
need to think about Roles.
<P>
If you change your From address you may also find it useful to add the
changed From address to the
<a href="h_config_alt_addresses">Alt-Addresses</a>
configuration option.
<P>
Because commas are used in the configuration file to separate the
list of Customized-Hdrs, you need to quote the value if that value
contains a comma.
Use double quotes and place the quotes around the entire value part of
the header, not including the name of the header.
For example, you might have
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Organization: &quot;My Organization Name, My City&quot;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
as one of the Customized-Hdrs.

<H1>OPTION: Viewer-Hdrs</H1>

You may change the default list of headers that are viewed by listing
the headers you want to view here.  If the headers in your
&quot;Viewer-Hdrs&quot; list are present in the message, then they
will be shown.  The order of the headers you list will be honored.  If
the special value &quot;all-except&quot; is included as the first
header in the &quot;Viewer-Hdrs&quot; list, then all headers in the
message except those in the list will be shown.  The values are all
case insensitive.

<P>
Note that once you put anything in the &quot;Viewer-Hdrs&quot; list,
then the original default headers are ignored.  So, if you just wanted
to add the header Organization to the list, you would have to list
Organization plus all of the other headers originally in the default
list.  If you just included Organization and nothing else, then you
would see only the Organization header, nothing else.

<P>
The default list of headers includes:
<UL>
  <LI>From
  <LI>Resent-From
  <LI>To
  <LI>Resent-To
  <LI>Cc
  <LI>Resent-cc
  <LI>Bcc

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Viewer-Margin-Left</H1>

This variable controls the left-hand vertical margin's width in
Pine's Message Viewing screen.
Its value is the number of space characters preceding each displayed line.
For consistency with
<A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_right">Viewer-Margin-Right</A>,
you may specify the column number to start in
(column numbering begins with number 1)
instead of the width of the margin by appending a lower case letter
&quot;c&quot; to the number.
For example, a value of &quot;2c&quot; means to start the text in column two,
which is entirely equivalent to a value of &quot;1&quot;, which means to
leave a margin of 1 space.
<P>
The default is a left margin of 0 (zero).
Misconfigurations (for example, negative values or values with starting
left columns greater than the ending right column)
are silently ignored.
If the number of columns for text between the Viewer-Margin-Left and
the Viewer-Margin-Right is fewer than 8, then margins of zero will be used
instead.

<H1>OPTION: Viewer-Margin-Right</H1>

This variable controls the right-hand vertical margin's width in
Pine's Message Viewing screen.
Its value is the number of space characters following each displayed line.
You may specify the column number to end the text in
(column numbering begins with number 1)
instead of the width of the margin by appending a lower case letter
&quot;c&quot; to the number.
For example, a value of &quot;76c&quot; means to end the text in column 76.
If the screen is 80 characters wide, this is equivalent to a value
of &quot;4&quot;, which means to leave a margin of 4 spaces.
However, if you use different size screens at different times, then these
two values are not equivalent.
<P>
The default right margin is 4.
Misconfigurations (for example, negative values or values with starting
left columns greater than the ending right column)
are silently ignored.
If the number of columns for text between the
<A HREF="h_config_viewer_margin_left">Viewer-Margin-Left</A> and

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: Quote-Suppression-Threshold</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Quote-Suppression-Threshold</H1>

This option should be used with care.
It will cause some of the quoted text to be eliminated from the
display when viewing a message in the MESSAGE TEXT screen.
For example, if you set the Quote-Suppression-Threshold to the
value &quot;5&quot;,
this will cause quoted text that is longer than five lines to be truncated.
Quoted text of five or fewer consecutive lines will be displayed in its entirety.
Quoted text of more than six lines will have the first five lines displayed
followed by a line that looks something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[ 12 lines of quoted text hidden from view ]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
As a special case, if exactly one line of quoted text would be hidden, the
entire quote will be shown instead.
So for the above example, quoted text which is exactly six lines long will
will be shown in its entirety.
(In other words, instead of hiding a single line and adding a line
that announces that one line was hidden, the line is just shown.)
<P>
If the sender of a message has carefully chosen the quotes that he or she
includes, hiding those quotes may change the meaning of the message.
For that reason, Pine requires that when you want to set the value of this
variable to something less than four lines, you actually have to set it
to the negative of that number.
So if you want to set this option to &quot;3&quot;, you actually have to
set it to &quot;-3&quot;.
The only purpose of this is to get you to think about whether or not you
really want to do this!
If you want to delete all quoted text you set the value of this option
to the special value &quot;-10&quot;.
<P>
The legal values for this option are
<P>
<TABLE>   
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Default, don't hide anything </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;-1,-2,-3&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Suppress quote lines past 1, 2, or 3 lines </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;4,5,6,...&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Suppress if more than that many lines </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD>
  <TD> Suppress all quoted lines </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
If you set this option to a non-default value you may sometimes wish to
view the quoted text that is not shown.
When this is the case, the
<A HREF="h_common_hdrmode">HdrMode Command</A>
may be used to show the hidden text.
Typing the &quot;H&quot; command once will show the hidden text.
Typing a second &quot;H&quot; will also turn on Full Header mode.
The presence or absence of the HdrMode command is determined by the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_full_hdr">&quot;Enable-Full-Header-Cmd&quot;</A>
Feature-List option in your Pine configuration, so you will want to
be sure to turn that on if you use quote suppression.
<P>
For the purposes of this option, a quote is a line that begins with the
character &quot;&gt;&quot;.
<P>
Quotes are only suppressed when displaying a message on the screen.
The entire quote will be left intact when printing or forwarding or something
similar.

<TITLE>OPTION: Saved-Msg-Name-Rule</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Saved-Msg-Name-Rule</H1>

This option determines the default folder name when saving
a message.

<P>
The default option is &quot;default-folder&quot;, which is the folder
called &quot;saved-messages&quot; in Unix Pine and
&quot;savemail&quot; in PC-Pine.  To change the default folder, modify
the Pine option called
<A HREF="h_config_def_save_folder">&quot;Default-Saved-Msg-Folder&quot;</A>.

<P>
Choosing any of the &quot;by-&quot; options cause Pine to attempt to
get the chosen option's value for the message being saved (or for the
first message being saved if using an aggregrate save).
For example, if &quot;by-from&quot; is chosen, Pine attempts to get the
value of who the message came from (i.e. the from address).
Pine then attempts to save the message to a folder matching that value.
If &quot;by-from&quot; is chosen and no value is obtained, Pine uses
&quot;by-sender&quot;.
The opposite is also true.
If &quot;by-recipient&quot; is chosen and the message was posted to a
newsgroup, Pine will use the newsgroup name.
If &quot;by-replyto&quot; is chosen and no value is obtained, Pine uses
&quot;by-from&quot;.

<P>
If any of the &quot;by-realname&quot; options are chosen, Pine will attempt
to use the personal name part of the address instead of the mailbox part.
If any of the &quot;by-nick&quot; options are chosen, the
address is looked up in your address book and if found, the
nickname for that entry is used.
Only simple address book entries are checked, not distribution lists.
Similarly, if any of the
&quot;by-fcc&quot; options are chosen, the fcc from the corresponding
address book entry is used.
If by-realname, or the by-nick or by-fcc lookups result in no value,
then if the chosen option ends with the &quot;then-from&quot;,
&quot;then-sender&quot;, &quot;then-replyto&quot;,
or &quot;then-recip&quot; suffix, Pine
reverts to the same behavior as &quot;by-from&quot;,
&quot;by-sender&quot;, &quot;by-replyto&quot;, or &quot;by-recip&quot;
depending on which option was specified.
If the chosen option doesn't end with one of
the &quot;then-&quot; suffixes, then Pine reverts to the default
folder when no match is found in the address book.

<P>
Choosing the option called &quot;last-folder-used&quot;, causes Pine
to save to the folder that you saved to the last time you saved a
message.  The first time you save a message in a Pine session, Pine
attempts to save the message to the default folder.

<P>
Here is an example to make some of the options clearer.
If the message is From
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Fred Flintstone &lt;flint@bedrock.org&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and this rule is set to &quot;by-from&quot;, then the default folder offered
in the save dialog would be &quot;flint&quot;.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-realname-of-from&quot; then the default would
be &quot;Fred Flintstone&quot;.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-nick-of-from&quot; then Pine will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has a nickname associated with it, that nickname
will be offered as the default folder.
If not, the default saved message folder will be offered as the default.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-fcc-of-from&quot; then Pine will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has an Fcc associated with it, that Fcc
will be offered as the default folder.
If not, the default saved message folder will be offered as the default.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-nick-of-from-then-from&quot; then Pine will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has a nickname associated with it, that nickname
will be offered as the default folder.
If it is not found (or has no nickname) then the default offered will be
the same as it would be for the &quot;by-from&quot; rule.
That is, it would be &quot;flint&quot;

The Character-Set configuration option is used for both displaying

<P>
When displaying a message, Pine compares this setting to the character
set specified in the message.  If they do not match, then Pine places
a comment in the displayed text (enclosed in square-brackets) indicating
that some characters may not be displayed correctly.
This comment may be eliminated by turning on the option
<A HREF="h_config_quell_charset_warning">Quell-Charset-Warning</A>.

<P>
When sending a message the text typed in the composer and all text
attachments are labeled with the character set specified by this option.

<P>
The default value for this option is &quot;US-ASCII&quot;.
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
The value you choose for this option should be consistent with 
your system's Regional Settings.
<!--chtml else-->
The value you choose for this option should reflect the character
set supported by the terminal or emulator Pine is using for its display
since that device is responsible for rendering the non-US-ASCII
characters.  Similarly, how you input 8-bit characters is a function
of the display device, and not something Pine can provide.  You'll need
to consult the terminal (or emulator) documention for input instruction.
<!--chtml endif-->
Typical values for this option might include
&quot;ISO-8859-<I>N</I>&quot;, where <I>N</I> might be a number
between 1 and 9, or 13, or 15.

<P>
If this option is set to something other than &quot;US-ASCII&quot;,
then its value will be used to label text you send that contains
non US-ASCII (sometimes called &quot;8-bit&quot;) characters.  However,
if the text does <EM>not</EM> contain any such characters, it will be
labeled as &quot;US-ASCII&quot;, independent of this option's value.

<P>
If this option is <EM>not</EM> set and the message text you are sending
or any text attachments are found to contain non US-ASCII 
(or &quot;8-bit&quot;) characters, then Pine

Editor specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer. This is

this setting to specify an alternate editor to use occasionally or if you
have a favorite editor and want to use it all the time (see the 
<A HREF="h_config_alt_ed_now">&quot;Enable-Alternate-Editor-Implicitly&quot;</A> setting).  <P>
If you specify multiple editors for this option, ^_ will invoke the first one 
of those specified that exists and is executable.  When specifying a program 
for use here, make sure that the format of the text it saves -- which, when 
you exit it, will become the message body in Pine -- is appropriate 
for the body of an email message; avoid proprietary formats that may result in 
a message body that the recipient of your message will be unable to decipher.

If you are in doubt about what editors are available on your system, or which

<P>
Note that if <a href="h_config_quell_flowed_text">Quell-Flowed-Text</a> is

<H1>OPTION: Speller</H1>

This option affects the behavior of the ^T (spell check) command in the
Composer.  It specifies the program invoked by ^T in the Composer.  By
default, Pine uses the system's &quot;spell&quot; command.  Pine will use the
command defined by this option (if any) instead.  When invoking the
spell-checking program, Pine appends a tempfile name (where the message is
passed) to the command line. Pine expects the speller to correct the
spelling in that file. When you exit from that program Pine will read the
tempfile back into the composer.

<P>
If you are using Unix Pine and your system has the &quot;ispell&quot; command,
it is a reasonable choice for a speller program.

<P>
If this option is not set, then the system's &quot;spell&quot; command is used.
The spell command does not work the same as the alternate speller.
It produces a list of misspelled words on its standard output, instead.
Don't set this speller option to the standard Unix spell command.
That won't work. If you want to use the standard Unix spell command,
set the speller option to nothing.

<H1>OPTION: Display-Filters</H1>

This option defines a list of text-filtering commands (programs or
scripts) that may be used to filter text portions of received messages
prior to their use (e.g., presentation in the &quot;MESSAGE TEXT&quot;
display screen, exporting to a text file).  
For security reasons, the full path name of the
filter command must be specified.  As of version 4.60, Display-Filters
can also be made to work on PC-Pine.

<P>
The command is executed and the message is piped into its standard input. 
The standard output of the command is read back by Pine.  The
&quot;_TMPFILE_&quot; token (see below) overrides this default behavior. 

<P> 
The filter's use is based on the configured &quot;trigger&quot; string.  The
format of a filter definition is:

<P>   
<CENTER>&lt;trigger&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;</CENTER>

<P>
You can specify as many filters as you wish, separating them with a comma.  
Each filter can have only one trigger and command.  Thus, two trigger 
strings which invoke the same command require separate filter 
specifications. 

<P> 
The &quot;trigger&quot; is simply text that, if found in the message,
will invoke the associated command.  If the trigger contains any space
characters, it must be placed within quotes.  Likewise, should you
wish a filter to be invoked unconditionally, define the trigger as the
null string, &quot;&quot; (two consecutive double-quote characters).  If the
trigger string is found anywhere in the text of the message the filter
is invoked.  Placing the trigger text within the tokens defined below
changes where within the text the trigger must be before considering
it a match.

<P>  
Trigger Modifying Tokens:
<DL>
<DT>_CHARSET(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>This token tells Pine to invoke the supplied command
if the text is in a character set matching <VAR>string</VAR>
(e.g., ISO-8859-2 or ISO-2022-JP).
</DD>


<DT>_LEADING(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>This token tells Pine to invoke the supplied command
if the enclosed <VAR>string</VAR> is found to be the first
non-whitespace text.
<BR>NOTE: Quotes are necessary if <VAR>string</VAR> contains
the space character.
</DD>

<DT>_BEGINNING(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>This token tells Pine to invoke the supplied command
if the enclosed <VAR>string</VAR> is found at the beginning
of any line in the text.
<BR>NOTE: Quotes are necessary if <VAR>string</VAR> contains
the space character.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The &quot;command&quot; and &quot;arguments&quot; portion is simply
the command line to be invoked if the trigger string is found.  Below
are tokens that Pine will recognize and replace with special values
when the command is actually invoked.

<P>
Command Modifying Tokens:

<DL>
<DT>_TMPFILE_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of the temporary 
file containing the text to be filtered.  Pine 
expects the filter to replace this data with the 
filter's result.

<P>
NOTE: Use of this token implies that the text to 
be filtered is not piped into standard input of the 
executed command and its standard output is ignored. 
Pine restores the tty modes before invoking the
filter in case the filter interacts with the user
via its own standard input and output.  
</DD>
                        
<DT>_RESULTFILE_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
file intended to contain a status message from the 
filter.  Pine displays this in the message status 
field. 
</DD>
 
<DT>_DATAFILE_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
file that Pine creates once per session and deletes 
upon exit.  The file is intended to be used by the 
filter to store state information between instances 
of the filter.
</DD>
   
<DT>_PREPENDKEY_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token indicates that a random
number will be passed down the input stream before the message text.
This number could be used as a session key.  It is sent in this way to
improve security.  The number is unique to the current Pine session
and is only generated once per session.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_disable_reset_disp">Disable-Terminal-Reset-For-Display-Filters</A> is related.
<P>
Performance caveat/considerations:
<BR>
Testing for the trigger and invoking the filter doesn't come for free.
There is overhead associated with searching for the trigger string, testing
for the filter's existence and actually piping the text through the filter.
The impact can be reduced if the Trigger Modifying Tokens above are 
employed.

</DD>

<DT>_MIMETYPE_</DT>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is replaced in the
command name with a temporary file name used to accept any new MIME
Content-Type information necessitated by the output of the filter.
Upon the filter's exit, if the file contains new MIME type
information, Pine verifies its format and replaces the outgoing
message's MIME type information with that contained in the file. This
is basically a cheap way of sending something other than Text/Plain.

====== h_config_keywords =====
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: Keywords</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Keywords</H1>

You may define your own set of keywords and optionally set them on a
message by message basis.
These are similar to the &quot;Important&quot; flag which the user
may set using the Flag command.
The difference is that the Important flag is always present for each folder.
User-defined keywords are chosen by the user.
You may set up the list of possible keywords here.
Then you use the <A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag command</A>
to set or clear the keywords in each message.

<P>
Keywords may be used when Selecting messages (Select Keyword).
You will need to enable the
<A HREF="h_config_enable_agg_ops">&quot;Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set&quot;</A>
option to use Select.
Keywords may also be used in the Patterns of Rules (Filters, Indexcolors, etc).
Filter Rules may be used to set keywords automatically.
Keywords may be displayed as part of the Subject of a message by using
the SUBJKEY or SUBJKEYINIT tokens in the
<A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A> option.
The <A HREF="h_config_kw_braces">Keyword-Surrounding-Chars</A>
option may be used to modify the display of keywords using
SUBJKEY and SUBJKEYINIT slightly.
Keywords may also be displayed in a column of their own in the MESSAGE INDEX
screen by using the KEY or KEYINIT tokens.
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
Keywords are not supported by all mail servers.

<P>
You may give keywords nicknames if you wish.
If the keyword definition you type in contains a SPACE character, then the
actual value of the keyword is everything after the last SPACE and the
nickname for that keyword is everything before the last SPACE.
For example, suppose you are trying to interoperate with another email program
which uses a particular keyword with an unpleasant name.
Maybe it uses a keyword called
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>VendorName.SoftwareName.08</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
but for you that keyword means that the message is work-related.
You could define a keyword to have the value
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Work VendorName.SoftwareName.08</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and then you would use the name &quot;Work&quot; when dealing with
that keyword in Pine.
If you defined it as
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>My Work VendorName.SoftwareName.08</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
the nickname would be everything before the last SPACE, that is the nickname
would be &quot;My Work&quot;.
<P>
Some commonly used keywords begin with dollar signs.
This presents a slight complication, because the dollar sign is normally used
to signify
<A HREF="h_news_config">environment variable expansion</A>
in the Pine configuration.
In order to specify a keyword which begins with a dollar sign you must
precede the dollar sign with a second dollar sign to escape its special
meaning.
For example, if you want to include the keyword
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>$Label1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
as one of your possible keywords, you must enter the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>$$Label1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

instead.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Alt-Addresses</H1>

This option provides a place for you to list alternate email addresses
you may have.
Each address in the list should be the actual email address part of an
address, without the full name field or the angle brackets.
For example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>user@example.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

If set, the option affects the behavior of the Reply
command and the &quot;+&quot; symbol in the MESSAGE INDEX, which denotes that
a message has been addressed specifically to you.

<P>
In the default INDEX display
the personal name (or email address) of
the person listed in the message's &quot;From:&quot; header
field is usually displayed except when that address is yours or one of your
alternate addresses.
In that case you will usually see the name of
the first person specified in the
message's &quot;To:&quot; header field
with the prefix &quot;To: &quot; prepended.

<P>
With respect to Reply, the reply-to-all option will exclude addresses

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: Addressbook-Formats</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Addressbook-Formats</H1>

This option specifies the format that address books are displayed in.
Normally, address books are displayed with the nicknames in the first
column, the fullnames in the second column, and addresses in the third
column.  The system figures out reasonable defaults for the widths of
the columns.  An address book may be given a different format by
listing special tokens in the order you want them to display.  The
possible tokens are NICKNAME, FULLNAME, ADDRESS, FCC, and COMMENT.
So, for example, to get the default behavior you could list

<P>
<CENTER>Addressbook-Formats=NICKNAME FULLNAME ADDRESS</CENTER>

<P>
(You can also use the token DEFAULT to get the default behavior for
an address book format.)

<P>
The tokens are separated by spaces.  &quot;Addressbook-Formats&quot;
is a list, so if you have more than one address book you may have a
separate format for each by putting its format at the corresponding
location in the &quot;Addressbook-Formats&quot; list.

<P>

Listed first are the personal address books, then the global address
books.  So, if you have two personal address books and one global
address book, you may have up to three formats in the
&quot;Addressbook-Formats&quot; list.  If
&quot;Addressbook-Formats&quot; doesn't have as many elements as there
are address books, the last element is used repeatedly.

<P>

Each of the tokens may also be optionally followed by parentheses with
either a number or a percentage inside the parentheses.  For example,
<SAMP>FULLNAME(13)</SAMP> means to allocate 13 characters of space to
the fullnames column, <SAMP>FULLNAME(20%)</SAMP> means to allocate 20%
of the available space (the screen width minus the space for
inter-column spaces) to the fullnames column, while plain
<SAMP>FULLNAME</SAMP> means the system will attempt to figure out a
reasonable number of columns.

<P>
There are always 2 spaces between every column, so if you use
fixed column widths (like 13) you should remember to take that into
account.

<H1>OPTION: Index-Format</H1>

This option is used to customize the content of lines in the
<A HREF="h_mail_index">MESSAGE INDEX screen</A>.  Each line is intended 
to convey some amount of immediately relevant information about each 
message in the current folder.
<P>

Pine provides a pre-defined set of informational fields with
reasonable column widths automatically computed.  You can, however,
replace this default set by listing special tokens in the order you
want them displayed.
<P>

The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.
<P>

Spaces are used to separate listed tokens.  Additionally, you can
specify how much of the screen's width the taken's associated data
should occupy on the index line by appending the token with a pair of
parentheses enclosing either a number or percentage.  For example,
&quot;SUBJECT(13)&quot; means to allocate 13 characters of space to the subject
column, and &quot;SUBJECT(20%)&quot; means to
allocate 20% of the available space
to the subjects column, while plain &quot;SUBJECT&quot; means the system will
attempt to figure out a reasonable amount of space.
<P>

There is always one space between every pair of columns, so if you use fixed
column widths (like 13) you should remember to take that into account.
Several of the fields are virtually fixed-width, so it doesn't make
much sense to specify the width for them.  The fields STATUS,
FULLSTATUS, IMAPSTATUS, MSGNO, the DATE fields, SIZE,
and DESCRIPSIZE all fall into that category.
You <EM>may</EM> specify widths for those if you wish, but
you're probably better off letting the system pick those widths.  <P>

<P>
The default is equivalent to:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Index-Format=STATUS MSGNO DATE FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
This means that the four fields without percentages will be allocated
first, and then 33% and 67% of the <EM>remaining</EM> space will go to
the from and subject fields.  If one of those two fields is specified
as a percentage and the other is left for the system to choose, then
the percentage is taken as an absolute percentage of the screen, not
of the space remaining after allocating the first four columns.  It
doesn't usually make sense to do it that way.  If you leave off all
the widths, then the subject and from fields (if both are present) are
allocated space in a 2 to 1 ratio, which is almost exactly the same as
the default.

<P>
What you are most likely to do with this configuration option is to
specify which fields appear at all, which order they appear in, and the
percentage of screen that is used for the from and subject fields if you
don't like the 2 to 1 default.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Reply-Leadin</H1>

This option is used to customize the content of the introduction line
that is included when replying to a message and including the original
message in the reply.
The normal default (what you will get if you delete this variable) looks
something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On Sat, 24 Oct 1998, Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where the day of the week is only included if it is available in the
original message.
You can replace this default with text of your own.
The text may contain tokens which are replaced with text
which depends on the message you are replying to.
For example, the default is equivalent to:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM_ wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

Since this variable includes regular text mixed with special tokens
the tokens have to be surrounded by underscore characters.
For example, to use the token &quot;<SAMP>DATE</SAMP>&quot;
you would need to use &quot;<SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP>&quot;,
not &quot;<SAMP>DATE</SAMP>&quot;.
<P>
The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="h_index_tokens">here</A>.

<P>
For the adventurous, there is a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
It's explained in detail
<A HREF="h_reply_token_conditionals">here</A>.

<P>
If your &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot; turns out to be longer
than 80 characters when replying to a particular message, it is shortened.

<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token
in the introduction line you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#92;_DAYDATE_ = _DAYDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DAYDATE_ = Sat, 24 Oct 1998</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.

An old copy can be put back into use by
deleting and expunging newer versions of the data from the folder.

<H1>OPTION: Tcp-Write-Warning-Timeout</H1>

Sets the time in seconds that Pine will
wait for a network write before warning you that things are moving slowly
and possibly giving you the option to break the connection.
The default is 0 which means it is unset. If set to a non-zero value, the
minimum is 5 and the maximum is 1000.

When Pine times out a network read or write it will normally just display
a message saying &quot;Still waiting&quot;.
However, if enough time has elapsed since it started waiting it will offer
to let you break the connection.
That amount of time is set by this option, which defaults to 60 seconds,
has a minimum of 5 seconds, and a maximum of 1000 seconds.

<H1>FEATURE: Disable-2022-JP-Conversions</H1>

By default, UNIX Pine will convert Japanese characters encoded as
ISO-2022-JP data into EUC-JP and PC-Pine
will convert the ISO-2022-JP data into Shift-JIS before displaying it.
Conversely, when sending mail, UNIX Pine will convert EUC-JP into ISO-2022-JP
and PC-Pine will convert Shift-JIS into ISO-2022-JP.
If this feature is set, those conversions are turned off.
<P>
Most of Pine is not set up to handle multi-byte characters or variable width
characters.
From time to time, your display will be garbled because Pine's word wrapping
code, which is not aware of the possibility that characters may be
multi-byte, may wrap a line in the middle of a character.
Pico is also not able to edit Japanese data well so you may need to use an
<A HREF="h_config_enable_alt_ed">alternate editor</A>
when composing or replying to mail.

By default, if your
<A HREF="h_config_char_set">&quot;Character-Set&quot;</A>
is different from the character set
of the message you are viewing, then Pine will
attempt to convert the characters in the message
to the character set you have set
in the &quot;Character-Set&quot; configuration option before
sending them to your display.
The currently supported conversions are between 8-bit character sets (e.g.
between WINDOWS-1251 and KOI8-R), and from UTF-8 to any other character
set.
<P>
If this feature is set, the conversions are turned off.
<P>
Conversion is only possible if the character being converted is present in
both character sets.
Many pairs of character sets have no characters in common.
In that case, Pine will not attempt any conversion.
If there are some characters in common then Pine will attempt to convert
those and will display the unknown characters as question marks.
<P>
The conversion of Japanese character sets from one encoding to another
is controlled separately by the
<A HREF="h_config_disable_2022_jp_conv">Disable-2022-JP-Conversions</A>

<H1>OPTION: Disable-These-Drivers</H1>

This variable is a list of mail drivers which will be disabled.
The candidates for disabling are listed below.
There may be more in the future if you compile Pine with
a newer version of the c-client library.
<P>

<LI> mtx
<LI> mx
<LI> news
<LI> phile
<LI> tenex
<LI> unix
</UL>
<P>

The <EM>mbox</EM> driver enables the following behavior: if there is a
file called <CODE>mbox</CODE>
in your home directory, and if that file is either empty or in Unix mailbox
format, then every time you open <EM>INBOX</EM> the <EM>mbox</EM> driver
will automatically transfer mail from the system mail spool directory into the
<CODE>mbox</CODE> file and
delete it from the spool directory. If you disable the <EM>mbox</EM> driver,
this will not happen.
<P>

It is not recommended to disable the driver which supports the system default
mailbox format. On most non-SCO systems, that driver is the
<EM>unix</EM> driver.
On most SCO systems, it is the <EM>mmdf</EM> driver.
The system default driver may be
configured to something else on your system; check with your system manager
for additional information.
<P>

It is most likely not very useful for you to disable any of the drivers other
than possibly <EM>mbox</EM>.
You could disable some of the others if you know for
certain that you don't need them but the performance gain in doing so
is very modest.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Disable-These-Authenticators</H1>

This variable is a list of SASL (Simple Authentication and Security
Layer) authenticators which will be disabled.
SASL is a mechanism for
authenticating to IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and other network servers.
<P>

Pine matches its list of supported authenticators with the server to
determine the most secure authenticator that is supported by both.
If no matching authenticators are found, Pine will revert to plaintext
login (or, in the case of SMTP, will be unable to authenticate at all).
<P>
The candidates for disabling can be found <A HREF="X-Pine-Config:">here</A>.
<P>

Normally, you will not disable any authenticators.
There are two exceptions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> You use a broken server that advertises an authenticator,
but does not actually implement it.
<LI> You have a Kerberos-capable version of Pine and the server is
also Kerberos-capable, but you can not obtain Kerberos
credentials on the server machine, thus you desire to disable
GSSAPI (which in turn disables Pine's Kerberos support).
</OL>
<P>
It is never necessary to disable authenticators, since Pine will try
other authenticators before giving up.
However, disabling the relevant authenticator avoids annoying error messages.

<H1>OPTION: Dead-Letter-Files</H1>


This option affects Pine's behavior when you cancel a message being
composed.  Pine's usual behavior is to write the canceled message to
a file named 
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR&quot;,
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter&quot; in your home directory,
<!--chtml endif-->
overwriting any previous message.
<P>
If you set this option to a value higher than one, then that many copies
of dead letter files will be saved.
For example, if you set this option to &quot;3&quot; then you may have
files named
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR&quot;,
&quot;DEADLETR2&quot;, and
&quot;DEADLETR3&quot;.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter&quot;,
&quot;dead.letter2&quot;, and
&quot;dead.letter3&quot; in your home directory.
<!--chtml endif-->
In this example, the most recently cancelled message will be in
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR&quot;,
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter&quot;,
<!--chtml endif-->
and the third most recently cancelled message will be in
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
&quot;DEADLETR3&quot;.
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;dead.letter3&quot;.
<!--chtml endif-->
The fourth most recently cancelled message will no longer be saved.

<P>
If you set this option to zero, then NO record of canceled messages is
maintained.
<P>
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_quell_dead_letter">Quell-Dead-Letter-On-Cancel</A>
is set, that overrides whatever you set for this option.
If this option had existed at the time, then the Quell feature would not
have been added, but it is still there for backwards compatibility.
So, in order for this option to have the desired effect, make sure the
Quell feature is turned off.

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: Max-Remote-Connections</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Max-Remote-Connections</H1>

This option affects low-level behavior of Pine.
The default value for this option is <EM>2</EM>.
If your INBOX is accessed using the IMAP protocol
from an IMAP server, that connection is kept open throughout the
duration of your Pine session, independent of the value of this option.
The same is true of any 
<A HREF="h_config_permlocked">&quot;Stay-Open-Folders&quot;</A>
you have defined.
This option controls Pine's behavior when connecting to remote IMAP folders
other than your INBOX or your Stay-Open-Folders.
It specifies the maximum number of remote IMAP connections (other than
those mentioned above) that Pine will use for accessing the rest of your
folders.
If you set this option to zero, you will turn off most remote connection
re-use.
It's difficult to understand exactly what this option does, and it is usually
fine to leave it set to its default value.
It is probably more likely that you will be interested in setting the
<A HREF="h_config_permlocked">&quot;Stay-Open-Folders&quot;</A> option
instead of changing the value of this option.
A slightly longer explanation of what is going on with this option
is given in the next paragraphs.

<P>
There are some time costs involved in opening and closing remote IMAP 
folders, the main costs being the time you have to wait for the connection
to the server and the time for the folder to open.
Opening a folder may involve not only the time the server takes to do its
processing but time that Pine uses to do filtering.
These times can vary widely.
They depend on how loaded the server is, how large
the folder being opened is, and how you set up filtering, among other things.
Once Pine has opened a connection to a particular folder, it will attempt
to keep that connection open in case you use it again.
In order to do this,
Pine will attempt to use the Max-Remote-Connections (the value of
this option) IMAP connections you have alloted for this purpose.
<P>
For example, suppose the value of this option is set to &quot;2&quot;.
If your INBOX is accessed on a remote server using the IMAP protocol, that
doesn't count as one of the remote connections but it is always kept open.
If you then open another IMAP folder, that would be your first
remote connection counted as one of the Max-Remote-Connections connections.
If you open a third folder the second will be left open, in case you
return to it.
You won't be able to tell it has been left open.
It will appear to be closed when you leave the folder but the connection
will remain in the background.
Now suppose you go back to the second folder (the first folder after the
INBOX).
A connection to that folder is still open so you won't have to wait
for the startup time to open it.
Meanwhile, the connection to the third folder will be left behind.
Now, if you open a fourth folder, you will bump into the
Max-Remote-Connections limit, because this will be the third folder other
than INBOX and you have the option set to &quot;2&quot;.
The connection that is being used for
the third folder will be re-used for this new fourth folder.
If you go back to the third folder after this, it is no longer already
connected when you get there.
You'll still save some time since Pine will re-use the connection to the
fourth folder and you have already logged in on that connection,
but the folder will have to be re-opened from scratch.
<P>
If a folder is large and the startup cost is dominated by the time it takes
to open that folder or to run filters on it, then it will pay to make the
value of this option large enough to keep it open.
On the other hand, if you only revisit a handful of folders or if
the folders are small, then it might
make more sense to keep this number small so that the reconnect
time (the time to start up a new connection and authenticate)
is eliminated instead.
<P>
You may also need to consider the impact on the server.
On the surface, a larger number here may cause a larger impact on the
server, since you will have more connections open to the server.
On the other hand, not only will <EM>you</EM> be avoiding the startup costs
associated with reopening a folder, but the <EM>server</EM> will be
avoiding those costs as well.
<P>
When twenty five minutes pass without any active use of an IMAP connection
being saved for possible re-use, that connection will be shut down,

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Stay-Open-Folders</H1>

This option affects low-level behavior of Pine.
There is no default value for this option.
It is related to the options
<A HREF="h_config_preopen_stayopens">&quot;Preopen-Stayopen-Folders&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_maxremstream">&quot;Max-Remote-Connections&quot;</A>,
and <A HREF="h_config_expunge_stayopens">&quot;Offer-Expunge-On-Stayopen-Folders&quot;</A>.

<P>
Note: changes made to this list take effect the next time you open a
folder in the list.

<P>
This is a list of folders that will be permanently kept open once they
are first opened.
The names in this list may be either the nickname of an Incoming folder
or the full technical specification of a folder.
The folders in this list need not be remote IMAP folders, they could usefully
be local folders, as well.
If a folder in the list is a newsgroup or is not accessed either locally
or via IMAP, then the entry will be ignored.
For example, folders accessed via NNTP or POP3 will not be kept open, since
the way that new mail is found with those protocols involves closing and
reopening the connection.
<P>
Once a Stay Open folder has been opened, new-mail checking will continue
to happen on that folder for the rest of the Pine session.
Your INBOX is always implicitly included in this Stay-Open list and doesn't
need to be added explicitly.
<P>
Another difference that you may notice between a Stay Open folder and a
non-Stay Open folder is which message is selected as the current message
when you enter the folder index.
Normally, the starting position for an incoming folder (which most Stay Open
folders will likely be) is controlled by the
<A HREF="h_config_inc_startup">Incoming-Startup-Rule</A>.
However, if a folder is a Stay Open folder, when you re-enter the folder
after the first time the current message will be the same as it was when
you left the folder.
An exception is made if you use the TAB command to get to the folder.
In that case, the message number will be incremented by one from what it
was when you left the folder.
<P>
The above special behavior is thought to be useful.
However, it is special and different from what you might at first expect.
The feature
<A HREF="h_config_use_reg_start_for_stayopen">Use-Regular-Startup-Rule-for-Stayopen-Folders</A>
may be used to turn off this special treatment.
<P>
If the message that was current when you left the folder no longer exists,
then the regular startup rule will be used instead.

This option controls when Pine's line-by-line scrolling occurs.
Typically, when a selected item is at the top or bottom screen edge
and the UP or DOWN (and Ctrl-P or Ctrl-N) keys are struck, the
displayed items are scrolled down or up by a single line.

<P>
This option allows you to tell Pine the number of lines from the top and
bottom screen edge that line-by-line paging should occcur.  For example,
setting this value to one (1) will cause Pine to scroll the display
vertically when you move to select an item on the display's top or
bottom edge.

By default, this variable is zero, indicating that scrolling happens
when you move up or down to select an item immediately off the display's

<H1>OPTION: Reply-Indent-String</H1>

This option specifies an aspect of Pine's Reply command.
When a message is replied to and the text of the message is included, the
included text usually has the string &quot;&gt; &quot; prepended
to each line indicating it is quoted text.
(In case you haven't seen this before, &quot;string&quot; is a technical term
which means chunk of text.)

<P>
This option specifies a different value for that string.
If you wish to use a string which begins or ends with a space,
enclose the string in double quotes.

<P>
Besides simple text, the prepended string can be based
on the message being replied to.
The following tokens are substituted for the message's corresponding value:

<DL>
<DT>_FROM_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the message sender's &quot;username&quot;.
If the name is longer than six characters, only the first six characters are
used.
</DD>

<DT>_NICK_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the nickname of the message sender's
address as found in your addressbook.
If no addressbook entry is found,
Pine replaces the characters &quot;_NICK_&quot; with nothing.
If the nickname is longer than six characters, only the first six characters are
used.
</DD>

<DT>_INIT_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the initials of the sender of the message.
</DD>

</DL>

NOTE: When the
<A HREF="h_config_prefix_editing">&quot;Enable-Reply-Indent-String-Editing&quot;</A>
feature is enabled, you are given the opportunity to edit the string, whether 
it is the default or one automatically generated using the above tokens.
<P>
If you change your Reply-Indent-String
so that it is not equal to the default value of &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot;, then
quoted text will not be flowed

when you reply.
For this reason, we recommend that you leave your Reply-Indent-String

<TITLE>OPTION: Quote-Replace-String</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Quote-Replace-String</H1>

This option specifies what string to use as a quote when <b>viewing</b> a
message.  The standard way of quoting messages when replying is the string
&quot;&gt; &quot; (quote space).
With this variable set, viewing a message will
replace occurrences of 
&quot;&gt; &quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; with the replacement string.
This setting works best when
<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string">Reply-Indent-String</A>
or the equivalent setting in your correspondents' mail programs
is set to the default
&quot;&gt; &quot;, but it will also work fine with the
Reply-Indent-String set to &quot;&gt;&quot;.
<P>
By default, this setting will only work on messages that are flowed, which is
the default way of sending messages for many mail clients including versions
of Pine after 4.60.  Enable the feature
<A HREF="h_config_quote_replace_noflow">Quote-Replace-Nonflowed</A>
to also have quote-replacement performed on non-flowed messages.
<P>

Setting this option will replace  &quot;&gt;&quot; and 
&quot;&gt; &quot; with the new setting. This string may include trailing
spaces. To preserve those spaces enclose the full string in double quotes.
<P>
No padding to separate the text of the message from the quote string is
added. This means that if you do not add trailing spaces to the value of
this variable, text will be displayed right next to the quote string,
which may be undesirable. This can be avoided by adding a new string
separated by a space from your selection of quote string replacement. This
last string will be used for padding. For example, setting this variable to 
<br>&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot; &quot; has the effect of setting
&quot;&gt;&quot; as the quote-replace-string, with the text padded by
a space from the last quote string to make it more readable.
<P>
One possible setting for this variable could be
&quot;    &quot; (four spaces wrapped in quotes), which
would have the effect of indenting each level of quoting four spaces and
removing the &quot;&gt;&quot;'s.  Different levels of quoting could be made
more discernible by setting colors for quoted text.
<P>
Replying to or forwarding the viewed message will preserve the original
formatting of the message, so quote-replacement will not be performed on
messages that are being composed.

<TITLE>OPTION: Status-Message-Delay</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Status-Message-Delay</H1>

This option has evolved over time, causing the possible values to be
counter-intuitive.
Read carefully before you set this option.
First we explain what the option does, then there is a longer discussion
following that.
<P>
If this is set to zero, the default value, it has <EM>no</EM> effect.
Positive and negative values serve two similar, but different purposes.
<P>
If it is set to a positive number, it causes the cursor to move to the
status line whenever a status message is printed and pause there for this
many seconds.
It will probably only be useful if the 
<A HREF="h_config_show_cursor">&quot;Show-Cursor&quot;</A> feature is
also turned on.
Setting this option to a postive number can only be used to
<EM>increase</EM> the status message delay.
This may be useful for Braille displays, or other non-traditional displays.
<P>
If it is set to a negative number the interpretation is a bit complicated.
Negative numbers are used to <EM>decrease</EM> the amount of delay Pine uses to
allow you to read important status messages.
Of course, this may cause you to miss some important messages.
If you see a message flash by but miss what it says you can use the
Journal command from the Main menu to read it.
If you set this option to a negative value, the delay will be
no more than one second less than the absolute value
of the value you set.
So if you set it to -1, the delay will be no more than zero seconds, no
delay at all.
If you set it to -2, the delay will be no more than 1 second.
And so on, -3 is 2 seconds, -4 is 3 seconds, ...
If the delay that Pine would have used by default is less than this delay,
then the smaller delay set by Pine will be used.
Setting this option to a negative value can only reduce the amount of
delay, never increase it.
<P>
Here is a more detailed explanation.
Status messages are the messages which show up spontaneously in the
status message line, the third line from the bottom of the screen.
By default, Pine assigns each status message it produces a minimum
display time.
Some status messages have a minimum display time of zero.
You can see an example of such a message by paging up in this help text
until you reach the top of the screen.
If you try to page past the top you will see the message
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[Already at start of help text]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
in the status line.
If there is another more important use of the status message line this message
might be replaced quickly, or it even might not be shown at all.
However, if there is no reason to get rid of the message, it might stay
there for several seconds while you read the help.
An example where it is replaced immediately happens when you page up in
the help text past the top of the screen, but then type the &quot;WhereIs&quot;
command right after paging up.
The message will disappear immediately without causing a delay (unless you
have set this option to a positive value) to allow you to type input for
the &quot;WhereIs&quot; command.
Since it isn't a very important message, Pine has set its minimum display
time to zero seconds.
<P>
Other messages have minimum display times of three or more seconds.
These are usually error messages that Pine thinks you ought to see.
For example, it might be a message about a failed Save or a failed folder open.
It is often the case that this minimum display time won't delay you in
any way because the status message line is not needed for another reason.
However, there are times when Pine has to delay what it is doing in
order to display a status message for the minimum display time.
This happens when a message is being displayed and Pine wants to ask
for input from the keyboard.
For example, when you Save a message you use the status message line.
You get a prompt there asking for the name of the folder to save to.
If there is a status message being displayed that has not
yet displayed for its minimum
time Pine will display that status message surrounded with the characters
&gt; and &lt; to show you that it is delaying.
That might happen, for example, if you tried to save to a folder that
caused an error, then followed that immediately with another Save command.
You might find yourself waiting for a status message like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>[&gt;Can't get write access to mailbox, access is readonly&lt;]</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to finish displaying for three seconds.
If that is something you find happening to you frequently, you may use
negative values of this option to decrease or eliminate that delay, at
the risk of missing the message.

Because the file won't exist until after you start Pine, you must <EM>first</EM>
start Pine and <EM>then</EM> run the &quot;cat&quot; command.
You may be tempted to use &quot;tail -f filename&quot; to view the new
mail log.
However, the common implementations of the tail command will not do what you
are hoping.
<P>
The width of the messages produced for the FIFO may be altered with the
<A HREF="h_config_newmailwidth">NewMail-Window-Width</A> option.
<P>
On some systems, fifos may only be created in a local filesystem.
In other words, they may not be in NFS filesystems.
This requirement is not universal.
If the system you are using supports it, it should work.
(It is often the case that your home directory is in an NFS filesystem.
If that is the case, you might try using a file in the &quot;/tmp&quot;
filesystem, which is usually a local filesytem.)
Even when it is possible to use an NFS-mounted filesystem as a place to name
the fifo (for example, your home directory), it will still be the case that
the reader (probably the &quot;cat&quot; command) and the
writer (Pine) of the fifo must be running on the same system.

<H1>OPTION: NewMail-Window-Width</H1>

For UNIX Pine, this option is only useful if you have turned on the
<A HREF="h_config_fifopath">NewMail-FIFO-Path</A> option.
That option causes new mail messages to be sent to a fifo file.
Those messages will be 80 characters wide by default.
You can change the width of those messages by changing this option.
For example, if you are reading those messages in another window you might
want to set this width to the width of that other window.
<P>
If you are using PC-Pine, it has an option in the Config menu to turn
on the &quot;New Mail Window&quot;.
This present option also controls the width of that window.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Mail-Check-Interval</H1>

This option specifies, in seconds,
how often Pine will check for new mail.
If set to zero, new-mail checking is disabled.
(You can always manually force a new-mail check by typing ^L (Ctrl-L), which is also the command to refresh the screen, or by typing the Next command when the
current message is the last message of the folder.)
There is a minimum value for this option, normally 15 seconds.
The default value is normally 150 seconds.
The higher you set this option, the easier it is on the server.
<P>
There are some situations where automatic new-mail checking does not work.
See the discussion about new-mail checking in
<A HREF="h_config_reopen_rule">&quot;Folder-Reopen-Rule&quot;</A>.
<P>
The new-mail checking will not happen exactly at the frequency that you specify.
For example, Pine may elect to defer a non-INBOX mail check if you
are busy typing.
Or, it may check more frequently than you have specified if that is
thought to be necessary to keep the server from closing the connection
to the folder due to inactivity.
If Pine checks for new mail as a side effect of another command, it will reset
the timer, so that new-mail checking may seem to happen irregularly instead of
every X seconds like clockwork.
<P>
If you are anxious to know about new mail as soon as possible, set the check
interval low, and you'll know about the new mail by approximately
that amount of time after it arrives.
If you aren't so worried about knowing right away, set this option to a
higher value.
That will save the server some processing time and may save you some of
the time you spend waiting for new-mail checks to happen if you are
dealing with a slow server or slow network connection.
<P>
If you suspect that new-mail checking is causing slow downs for you,
you may want to look into the options
<A HREF="h_config_quell_checks_comp">&quot;Quell-Mailchecks-Composing-Except-Inbox&quot;</A>,
<A HREF="h_config_quell_checks_comp_inbox">&quot;Quell-Mailchecks-Composing-Inbox&quot;</A> and
<A HREF="h_config_mailchecknoncurr">&quot;Mail-Check-Interval-Noncurrent&quot;</A>,
which refine when mail checking is done.
<P>
If the mailbox being checked uses a <A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A> then
there is a minimum time
(<A HREF="h_config_maildropcheck">&quot;MailDrop-Check-Minimum&quot;</A>)
between new-mail checks.
Because of this minimum you may notice that new mail does not
appear promptly when you expect it.
The reason for this is to protect the server from over-zealous opening and
closing of the Mail Drop folder, since that is a costly operation.

<P>
If this option is set, then the normal new-mail checking which happens
while you are composing will not happen for folders other than your
INBOX (which depends on the setting
of &quot;Quell-Mailchecks-Composing-Inbox&quot;).
<P>
You might want to set this option if you are experiencing delays while
composing which you think might be related to the speed of the new-mail
checks.
<P>
Even with this option turned on, an occasional new-mail check may be done
in order to keep the server from killing the connection to the folder.
For example, IMAP servers may remove a connection to a folder if there
has been no activity on the connection for 30 minutes or more.
Instead of letting that happen, Pine will check for new mail before the
30 minutes is up even though you have turned on this feature to quell
those checks.
<P>
Besides new-mail checks, checkpoint operations on the folders
will also be quelled when you set this option.
The purpose of checkpointing is to write the changes to a folder out to
disk periodically in order to avoid losing those changes when system or
software problems occur.
New-mail checking and checkpointing while you are not composing are not
affected by this option.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: MailDrop-Check-Minimum</H1>

New-mail checking for a
<A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A> is a little different from new
mail checking for a regular folder.
One of the differences is that the connection to the Mail Drop is not
kept open and so the cost of checking
(delay for you and additional load for the server) may be significant.
Because of this additional cost we set a minimum time that
must pass between checks.
This minimum only applies to the automatic checking done by Pine.
If you force a check by typing ^L (Ctrl-L) or by typing the Next command when you are
at the end of a folder index, then the check is done right away.
<P>
This option specifies, in seconds, the <EM>minimum</EM> time between Mail Drop
new-mail checks.
You may want to set this minimum high in order to avoid experiencing some
of the delays associated with the checks.
Note that the time between checks is still controlled by the regular
<A HREF="h_config_mailcheck">Mail-Check-Interval</A> option.
When Pine is about to do an automatic check for new mail (because
the Mail-Check-Interval has expired) then if the time since the last
new-mail check
of any open Mail Drops has been greater than the MailDrop-Check-Minimum,
the Mail Drop is checked for new mail as well.
Therefore, it is only useful to set this option to a value that is higher
than the Mail-Check-Interval.
<P>
If this option is set to zero, automatic Mail Drop new-mail
checking is disabled.
There is a minimum value, normally 60 seconds.
The default value is normally 60 seconds as well.
This applies to the INBOX and to the currently open folder if that is
different from the INBOX.

<HEADER>
<TITLE>OPTION: NNTP-Range</TITLE>
</HEADER>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: NNTP-Range</H1>

This option applies only to newsgroups accessed using the NNTP protocol.
It does not, for example,
apply to newsgroups accessed using an IMAP-to-NNTP proxy.

<P>
When you open a connection to a News server using the NNTP protocol, you
normally have access to all of the articles in each newsgroup.
If a server keeps a large backlog of messages it may speed performance
some to restrict attention to only the newer messages in a group.
This option allows you to set how many article numbers should be checked
when opening a newsgroup.
You can think of &quot;NNTP-Range&quot; as specifying the maximum number
of messages you ever want to see.
For example, if you only ever wanted to look at the last 500 messages in each
newsgroup you could set this option to 500.
In actuality, it isn't quite that.
Instead, for performance reasons, it specifies the range of article
numbers to be checked, beginning
with the highest numbered article and going backwards from there.
If there are messages that have been canceled or deleted
their article numbers are still counted as part of the range.
<P>
So, more precisely, setting the &quot;NNTP-Range&quot; will cause article
numbers
<P><CENTER>last_article_number - NNTP-Range + 1 through last_article_number</CENTER>
<P>
to be considered when reading a newsgroup.
The number of messages that show up in your index will be less than or equal
to the value of &quot;NNTP-Range&quot;.

<P>
The purpose of this option is simply to speed up access when reading news.
The speedup comes because Pine can ignore all but the last NNTP-Range article
numbers, and can avoid downloading any information about the ignored articles.
There is a cost you pay for this speedup.
That cost is that there is no way for you to see those ignored articles.
The articles that come before the range you specify are invisible to you and
to Pine, as if they did not exist at all.
There is no way to see those messages using, for example, an unexclude command
or something similar.
The only way to see those articles is to set this option high enough (or
set it to zero) and then to reopen the newsgroup.

<P>
If this option is set to 0 (which is also the default),
then the range is unlimited.
This option applies globally to all NNTP servers and to all newsgroups
on those servers.
There is no way to set different values for different newsgroups or servers.

<H1>OPTION: Threading-Display-Style</H1>

When a folder is sorted by Threads or OrderedSubject,
this option will affect the MESSAGE INDEX display.
By default, Pine will display the MESSAGE INDEX in the
&quot;show-thread-structure&quot; style if a folder is sorted
by Threads or OrderedSubject.
<P>

The possible values for this option are:

<DL>
<DT>none</DT>
<DD>Regular index display.
The same index line as would be displayed without threading is used.
The only difference will be in the order of the messages.
</DD>

<DT>show-thread-structure</DT>
<DD>Threaded Subjects will be indented and vertical bars and horizontal
lines will be added to make it easier to see the relationships among
the messages in a thread (a conversation).
</DD>

<DT>mutt-like</DT>
<DD>This is the same as the option above except that the Subject
is suppressed (is blank) if it matches the previous Subject in the thread.
The name comes from the email client <A HREF="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</A>.
Here is an example of what a mutt-like index might look like.
In this example, the first column represents the message number, the
<A HREF="h_config_thread_index_style">Threading-Index-Style</A>
is set to &quot;regular-index-with-expanded-threads&quot;, and the
<A HREF="h_config_thread_lastreply_char">Threading-Lastreply-Character</A>

<H1>OPTION: Pruning-Rule</H1>

By default, Pine will ask at the beginning of each month whether or not
you want to rename your sent-mail folder to a name like sent-mail-month-year.
(See the feature <A HREF="h_config_prune_uses_iso">Prune-Uses-YYYY-MM</A> to
change the format of the folder to sent-mail-yyyy-mm.)
It will also ask whether you would like to delete old sent-mail folders.
If you have defined
<A HREF="h_config_read_message_folder">Read-Message-Folder</A>
or
<A HREF="h_config_pruned_folders">Pruned-Folders</A>
Pine will also ask about pruning those folders.
<P>

With this option you may provide an automatic answer to these questions.
The default value is to ask you what you'd like to do.
<P>

The six possible values for this option are:

<DL>
<DT>ask about rename, ask about deleting</DT>
<DD>This is the default.
Pine will ask whether you want to rename the folders and whether you
want to delete each of the old folders.
</DD>

<DT>ask about rename, don't delete</DT>
<DD>Pine will ask whether you want to rename the folders, but won't
ask about or delete old folders.
</DD>

<DT>always rename, ask about deleting</DT>
<DD>This means you want to always answer yes and have Pine automatically
rename the folder if possible.
You will also be asked about deleting old folders.
</DD>

<DT>always rename, don't delete</DT>
<DD>This means you want to always answer yes and have Pine automatically
rename the folder if possible.
There will be no deleting of old folders.
</DD>

<DT>don't rename, ask about deleting</DT>
<DD>This means you want to always answer no.
Pine will not rename the folder.
You will be asked about deleting old folders.
</DD>

<DT>don't rename, don't delete</DT>
<DD>This means you want to always answer no.
Pine will not rename the folder.

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>OPTION: Folder-Reopen-Rule</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Folder-Reopen-Rule</H1>

Pine normally checks for new mail in the currently open folder
and in the INBOX every few <A HREF="h_config_mailcheck">minutes</A>.

<P>
There are some situations where automatic new-mail checking does not work.
For example, if a mail folder is opened using the POP protocol or a newsgroup
is being read using the NNTP protocol, then new-mail checking is disabled.

<P>
It may be possible to check for new mail in these cases by reopening the
folder.
Pine does not do this for you automatically, but you may do the commands
manually to cause this to happen.
You reopen by going back to the folder list screen from the message
index screen with the &quot;&lt;&quot; command,
and then going back into the message index screen with
the &quot;&gt;&quot; command.
(Actually, any method you would normally use to open a folder will work the
same as the &quot;&lt;&quot; followed by &quot;&gt;&quot; method.
For example, the GoTo Folder command will work, or you may use L to go to the
Folder List screen and Carriage Return to reopen the folder.)

<P>
There are some cases where Pine knows that reopening the folder should
be useful as a way to discover new mail.
At the time of this writing, connections made using the POP protocol,
news reading using the NNTP protocol, local news reading, and local
ReadOnly folders which are in the traditional UNIX or the MMDF format all
fall into this category.
There are other cases where it <EM>may</EM> be a way to discover new mail, but Pine
has no way of knowing, so it might also just be an exercise in futility.
All remote, ReadOnly folders other than those listed just above fall into this
category.
The setting of this option together with the type of folder
controls how Pine will react to the apparent attempt to reopen a folder.

<P>
If you don't reopen, then you will just be back in
the message index with no change.
You left the index and came back, but the folder remained &quot;open&quot;
the whole time.
However, if you do reopen the folder, the folder is closed and then reopened.
In this case, the current state of the open folder is lost.
The New status, Important and Answered flags,
selected state, Zoom state, collapsed or expanded state of threads,
current message number,
and any other temporary state is all lost when the reopen happens.
For POP folders (but not NNTP newsgroups) the Deleted flags are also lost.

<P>
In the possibilities listed below, the text says &quot;POP/NNTP&quot; in
several places.
That really implies the case where Pine knows it is a good way to discover
new mail, which is more than just POP and NNTP, but POP and NNTP are
the cases of most interest.
This option probably has more possible values than it deserves. They are:

<DL>
<DT>Always reopen</DT>
<DD>Pine will not ask whether you want to reopen but will just do the reopen
whenever you type a command that implies a reopen, regardless of the
access method.
In other words, it is assumed you would always answer Yes if asked
about reopening.
</DD>

<DT>Yes for POP/NNTP, Ask about other remote [Yes]</DT>
<DD>Pine will assume a Yes answer if the access method is POP or NNTP, but
will ask you whether to reopen other remote folders,
with a default answer of Yes.
</DD>

<DT>Yes for POP/NNTP, Ask about other remote [No]</DT>
<DD>Pine will assume a Yes answer if the access method is POP or NNTP, but
will ask you whether to reopen other remote folders,
with a default answer of No.
</DD>

<DT>Yes for POP/NNTP, No for other remote</DT>
<DD>Pine will assume a Yes answer if the access method is POP or NNTP, and
will assume a No answer for all other remote folders.
</DD>

<DT>Always ask [Yes]</DT>
<DD>Pine will not differentiate based on access method.
It will always ask for all remote folders, with a default answer of Yes.
</DD>

<DT>Always ask [No]</DT>
<DD>Pine will not differentiate based on access method.
It will always ask for all remote folders, with a default answer of No.
</DD>

<DT>Ask about POP/NNTP [Yes], No for other remote</DT>
<DD>Pine will ask if the access method is POP or NNTP, with a default answer
of Yes.
It will never attempt to reopen other remote folders.
</DD>

<DT>Ask about POP/NNTP [No], No for other remote</DT>
<DD>This is the default.
Pine will ask if the access method is POP or NNTP, with a default answer
of No.
It will never attempt to reopen other remote folders.
</DD>

<DT>Never reopen</DT>
<DD>Pine will never attempt to reopen already open folders.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Remember, wherever it says POP or NNTP above it really means POP or NNTP or
any of the other situations where it is likely that reopening is a good way
to discover new mail.

<P>
There is an alternative that may be of useful in some situations.
Instead of manually checking for new mail you can set up a
<A HREF="h_maildrop">Mail Drop</A>
and automatically check for new mail.

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: Incoming-Startup-Rule</H1>

This value affects Pine's behavior when opening the &quot;INBOX&quot; or 
one of the &quot;INCOMING MESSAGE FOLDERS&quot;.
It determines which message will be the <EM>current message</EM> when
the folder is first opened.
The default value is &quot;first-unseen&quot;.

<P>
The seven possible values for this option are:

<DL>
<DT>first-unseen</DT>
<DD>The current message is set to the first
unseen message which has not been marked deleted, or the last message if
all of the messages have been seen previously.
Messages which have not been seen or which have been seen but re-marked
as New are considered unseen messages.
See the note at the bottom of this help about newsgroups.
</DD>

<DT>first-recent</DT>
<DD>Similar to the default, but rather than starting on the first
unseen message Pine starts on the first <EM>recent</EM> message.
A message is recent if it arrived since the last time the folder was
open.  This value causes the current message to be set to the first
recent message if there is one, otherwise to the last
message in the folder.
</DD>

<DT>first-important</DT>
<DD>This will result in the current message being set to the first
message marked Important (but not Deleted).
If no messages are marked Important, then it will be the last message.
Messages are marked Important by <EM>you</EM>, not by the sender, using
the
<A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag command</A>.
Or they may be marked Important by a Pine
<A HREF="h_mainhelp_filtering">Filter</A>
which you have set up.
</DD>

<DT>first-important-or-unseen</DT>
<DD>This selects the first of the first unseen and the first important
messages.
</DD>

<DT>first-important-or-recent</DT>
<DD>This selects the first of the first recent and the first important
messages.
</DD>

<DT>first</DT>
<DD>Simply starts you on the <EM>first</EM> undeleted message in the folder.
If all messages are deleted you start on the last message.
</DD>

<DT>last</DT>
<DD>Simply starts you on the <EM>last</EM> undeleted message in the folder
If all messages are deleted you start on the last message.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
NOTE:  For newsgroups in the incoming collection, &quot;first-unseen&quot; and
&quot;first-recent&quot; are the same and are affected by whether or not the
feature 
<A HREF="h_config_news_uses_recent">&quot;News-Approximates-New-Status&quot;</A>
is turned on. 
Also, there is no permanent storage in news for an Important flag.
This means that no messages will be marked Important when a newsgroup is
first opened.

<TITLE>OPTION: URL-Viewers</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>OPTION: URL-Viewers</H1>
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
PC-Pine users do not need to enter anything here, unless:<UL>
<LI> they want to override, for use with Pine, the application defined
in the Windows operating system for handling URLs; or
<LI> they are (planning on) using the same configuration file with 
Unix Pine.
</UL>
<P>
Note that if using a viewer that has a space in its path, you should
use the DOS name for that directory or file. Example:
<PRE>
url-viewer=C:&#92;Progra~1&#92;mozilla&#92;mozilla.exe
</PRE>
<HR><P>
<!--chtml endif-->
This option affects Pine's handling of URLs that are found in 
messages you read.  Normally, only URLs Pine can handle directly
are automatically offered for selection in the &quot;Message
Text&quot; screen.  When one or more applications
capable of deciphering URLs on their command line are added here, Pine
will choose the first available to display URLs it cannot handle directly.
A viewer's availability is based on its being specified with a <B>full
directory path</B> and the evaluation of any optionally supplied
parameters described below.

<P>
Additionally, to support various connection methods and applications, each
entry in this list can optionally begin with one or more of
the following special tokens.  The allowed tokens include:

<P>
<DL>
<DT>_TEST(<VAR>test-string</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>
The <VAR>test-string</VAR> is a shell command that Pine will run to
evaluate a viewer's availability.  The command specified by the test
string is run and if its resulting exit status is non-zero, Pine will
not consider the associated viewer for use.
</DD>

<DT>_SCHEME(<VAR>scheme-list</VAR>)_</DT>
<DD>
The <VAR>scheme-list</VAR> is a list of one or more (comma-delimited)
URL schemes that are to be used with the associated viewer.  This is
the way to configure Pine to recognize URLs other than the built-in set.
<P>
It can also be used to override Pine's built-in handlers.
For example, you could specify &quot;news&quot; in the <VAR>scheme-list</VAR>,
and Pine would use (provided it passed all other criteria) the associated
viewer when it encounterd a URL of the form &quot;news:comp.mail.pine&quot;.

</DD>
</DL>

<P>
By default, Pine will simply append a space character followed by the
selected URL prior to launching the command in your specified SHELL.  You can
optionally specify where in the command the selected URL should appear
by using the &quot;_URL_&quot; token.  All occurrences found in the command
will be replaced with the selected URL before the command is handed
to the shell.  If such replacement occurs, the default appending of the
selected URL does not take place.

<P>
NOTE: If the viewer you specify has any command-line arguments,
including the &quot;_URL_&quot; token, you will need to add a
double-quote character before the command path and after the last
argument (see the &quot;lynx&quot; example below).

<P>
So, here are some example entries:
<PRE>
URL-Viewers = _TEST(&quot;test -n '$&#123;DISPLAY}'&quot;)_  /usr/local/bin/netscape
              &quot;/usr/local/bin/lynx _URL_&quot;
              C:&#92;BIN&#92;NETSCAPE.BAT
</PRE>
<P>
This example shows that for the first viewer in the list to be used
the environment variable &quot;DISPLAY&quot; must be defined.  If it
is, then the path and file &quot;/usr/local/bin/netscape&quot; must exist.  
If neither condition is met,
then the path and file &quot;/usr/local/bin/lynx&quot; must exist.  
If it does, then the &quot;_URL_&quot; token is replaced by the selected URL. 
If the path to &quot;lynx&quot; is invalid,
then the final path and file C:&#92;BIN&#92;NETSCAPE.BAT must exist.  
Note that the last
entry is a DOS/Windows path.  This is one way to support Pine running
on more than one architecture with the same configuration file.<P>
<P>
<!--chtml if pinemode="os_windows"-->
<!--chtml else-->
Note that depending on the type of browser used and the method of 
its invocation (such as whether it will open in a separate window) from
the MESSAGE TEXT screen, the browser may &quot;supplant&quot; 
the MESSAGE TEXT screen, and you will have to quit the browser to return to 
it (for example, when using Lynx; to exit Lynx, use the &quot;Q&quot; command).
In other words, launching the browser from Pine may make Pine 
&quot;disappear&quot; (although it is still &quot;running&quot;)
until you close the browser again.<P>

<BODY>
<H1>Defining URL-Viewers in an X windows 
environment: for advanced users and  systems administrators</H1>
If you are using Pine with an X-terminal (emulator) and want to define an 
X windows-based application in URL-Viewers, 
you may want to do so in a manner that causes any <B>already</B> 
invoked viewer application to be used for viewing URLs you select from Pine 
messages, and a <B>new</B> URL-viewer process to be 
started <B>only</B> if the same application has <B>not already</B> 
been launched -- for one reason, to avoid file-locking contentions among 
multiple invocations of the same URL-viewer application.  
(The example entries set in the help screen for the &quot;URL-Viewers&quot; 
option does not do this.)  A method of doing that would be:<OL>
<LI> use 
the _TEST(<VAR>test-string</VAR>)_ token in the <B>first</B> entry to 
check (using commands appropriate for your Unix shell
in place of <VAR>test-string</VAR>) for the presence of a 
lockfile created by the URL-viewer application -- which implies that the 
application is already running, though this is not foolproof. 
Following that in the same URL-Viewers entry, specify the 
application with its appropriate command line option(s) to 
show the URL selected from the Pine message in an already open window of 
that application, or perhaps in a new window of that application.  

<LI> In the 
<B>second</B> entry for the URL-Viewers option, specify the same 
application without those command line options, but this time using the 
_TEST(...)_ token to check whether the environment variable &quot;DISPLAY&quot;
is defined.
<LI> If you may be using Pine (with the same .pinerc file) outside of the X 
windows environment (for instance, using VT-100 terminal emulation), you 
may wish to specify a non-X windows URL-viewer application such as Lynx
as the last entry.
</OL><BR>
How exactly you define your URL-Viewers entries to do this will depend on 
the command shell, the URL-viewer application(s), and possibly the specific 
version of the latter, you are using.  
<P>
Relevant command 
line options for the Netscape browser for showing URLs (selected from Pine) 
when Netscape is already running are discussed in the document
&quot;Remote Control of UNIX Netscape&quot; 
found at the URL (as of 12 Aug. 1998):
<P>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html">http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html</A></CENTER>

<P>(If the URL-viewer application is 
<B>not</B> running on the same host as Pine, but being launched from an 
applications server, you may not be able to use the command line options for 
using an existing invocation of the application in Pine's URL-Viewers entry.)

This feature enables the &quot;H Full Headers&quot; command which toggles between
the display of all headers in the message and the normal edited view of
headers.  The Full Header command also controls which headers are included
for Export, Pipe, Print, Forward, and Reply functions.  (For Reply, the
Full Header mode will respect the

<P>
If Full Header mode has been turned on and you Forward a message, you will
be asked if you'd like to forward the message as an attachment, as opposed
to including the text of the message in the body of your new message.
<P>
If you have also turned on the
<A HREF="h_config_quote_suppression">&quot;Quote Suppression&quot;</A>
option then the Full Headers command actually rotates through three states
instead of just two.
The first is the normal view with long quotes suppressed.
The second is the normal view but with the long quotes included.
The last enables the display of all headers in the message.
When using Export, Pipe, Print, Forward, or Reply the quotes are
never suppressed, so the first two states are identical.
<P>
Normally, the Header Mode will reset
to the default behavior when moving to a new message.
The mode can be made to persist from message to message by setting the feature

command (provided it too is

By default, when the "* Flag" command is selected,
Pine offers a prompt to set one of several flags and also offers the
option of entering the detailed flag manipulation screen via the "^T"
key.
If you have
<A HREF="h_config_keywords">Keywords</A>
defined, then enabling this feature adds a shortcut way to set or unset
keywords.
You use &quot;*&quot; followed by the first letter of a keyword (or the nickname of
a keyword if you've given it a nickname) and that will set the keyword.
<P>
An example is easier to understand than the explanation.
The flag command can always be used to set the system flags.
For example, to set the Answered flag you would type
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>* A</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Now suppose you have defined a keyword &quot;Work&quot; using the Keywords
option in the Config screen.
By default, to set a keyword like &quot;Work&quot; you would usually
have to go to the Flag Details screen using
the &quot;^T To Flag Details&quot; command.
Instead, if you have enabled this feature, you may type
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>* W</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to set the Work flag, or
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>* ! W</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
to unset it.
Just like for the other flag setting commands, the case of the letter does
not matter, so &quot;w&quot; or &quot;W&quot; both set the &quot;Work&quot;
keyword.
<P>
Notice that you can only use this trick for one keyword that begins
with &quot;W&quot;.
If you happen to have a &quot;Work&quot; keyword and another keyword that is
&quot;WIFI&quot; the &quot;* W&quot; command will set the first one in
your list of keywords.
Also, there are five letters which are reserved for system
flags and the NOT command.
If you type &quot;* A&quot; it will always set the Answered flag, not
your &quot;Aardvark&quot; keyword.
In order to set the &quot;Aardvark&quot; keyword you'll still have to use
the Flag Details screen.
<P>
Because enabling the
<A HREF="h_config_flag_screen_default">Enable-Flag-Screen-Implicitly</A>
option causes Pine to skip directly to the Flag Details screen when the
Flag command is used, 
setting it will cause this feature to have no effect at all.

<H1>FEATURE: Compose-Rejects-Unqualified-Addrs</H1>

This feature controls one aspect of the message composer; in particular,
what happens when an unqualified name is entered into an address header.
If set, unqualified names entered as addresses will be treated as errors
unless they match an addressbook nickname.  Pine will not attempt to turn
them into complete addresses by adding your local domain.<P>

A complete (fully qualified) address is one containing a username followed
by an &quot;@&quot; (&quot;at&quot;) symbol, followed by a domain name (e.g.
&quot;jsmith@example.com&quot;).  An unqualified name is one <B>without</B> 
the &quot;@&quot; symbol and domain name (e.g. &quot;jsmith&quot;). 

(See also <A HREF="h_address_format">Explanation of Address formats</A>.)

<P>

When you enter a fully qualified address, Pine does not interpret or
modify it, but simply passes it on to the mail-transport-agent (MTA) for
your system.  Pine conforms to the Internet standards governing message
headers and will not send an unqualifed name to the MTA.  Therefore, when
you enter an unqualified name, Pine will normally attempt to turn it into
a fully qualified address, first by checking to see if you have entered a
matching nickname in your addressbook, or failing that, by simply adding
your own domain to the name entered.  So if your address is
&quot;jsmith@example.com&quot; and you enter &quot;fred&quot;, then (assuming 
&quot;fred&quot; is not a nickname in your addressbook), Pine will turn 
that into &quot;fred@example.com&quot;.<P>

There are situations where it is not desirable for Pine to interpret such
unqualified names as valid (local) addresses.  For example, if &quot;fred&quot;
turned out to be a typo (intended to be an addressbook nickname), but
there actually was a &quot;fred&quot; in your local domain, the message might 
be mis-delivered without your realizing it.  In order to reduce the likelihood
of such accidents, setting this feature will cause Pine to treat such
addresses as errors, and require that you explicitly enter the full local
address (e.g. &quot;fred@example.com&quot;) or correct the name so that it 
matches an address book nickname.<P>

Consider this a safety feature against mis-directed mail.

<H1>FEATURE: Quell-User-Lookup-In-Passwd-File</H1>

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Composer, and if needed, will
usually be set by your system manager in Pine's system-wide configuration
file. Specifically, if this feature is set, Pine will not attempt to look
in the system password file to find a Full Name for the entered address.
<P>
Normally, names you enter into address fields (e.g. To: or Cc:) are
checked against your address book(s) to see if they match an address book
nickname.  Failing that, (in Unix Pine) the name is then checked against
the Unix password file.  If the entered name matches a username in the
system password file, Pine extracts the corresponding Full Name information
for that individual, and adds that to the address being entered.
<P>
However, password file matching can have surprising (incorrect) results if
other users of the system do not receive mail at the domain you are using.
That is, if either the 
<A HREF="h_config_user_dom">&quot;User-Domain&quot;</A> or 
<A HREF="h_config_domain_name">&quot;Use-Only-Domain-Name&quot;</A>
option
is set such that the administrative domain of other users on the system
isn't accurately reflected, Pine should be told that a passwd file match
is coincidental, and Full Name info will be incorrect.  For example, a
personal name from the password file could get falsely paired with the
entered name as it is turned into an address in the configured domain.
<P>
If you are seeing this behavior, enabling this feature will prevent Unix
Pine from looking up names in the password file to find the Full Name
for incomplete addresses you enter.<P>

<H1>FEATURE: Enable-Incoming-Folders</H1>

Pine's Incoming Message Folders collection
provides a convenient way to access multiple incoming folders.
It is also useful if you have accounts on multiple computers.
<P>

If set, this feature defines a pseudo-folder collection called
&quot;INCOMING MESSAGE FOLDERS&quot;.  Initially, the only folder included
in this collection will be your INBOX, which will no longer show up in
your Default folder collection.
<P>

You may add more folders to the Incoming Message Folders collection by
using the
<!--chtml if pinemode="function_key"-->
&quot;F10
<!--chtml else-->
&quot;A
<!--chtml endif-->
Add&quot; command in the FOLDER LIST screen.  You will be prompted for
the host the folder is stored on (which defaults to the same host used
for your INBOX), a nickname, and the actual folder name.  Once a set
of Incoming Message Folders are defined, the TAB key (in MESSAGE INDEX
or MESSAGE TEXT screens) may be used to scan the folders for those
with Recent messages.  If you add more folders to
your Incoming-Folders collection, turning this feature back off will have
no effect.
<P>
NOTE: Normally the software which actually delivers mail (the stuff that happens
before Pine is involved) is in a better position to do delivery filtering
than is Pine itself.
If possible, you may want to look at programs such as
&quot;filter&quot; or &quot;procmail&quot;, which are examples of delivery
filtering programs.
If you'd prefer to have Pine do the filtering for you, you may set that
up.

<H1>FEATURE: Scramble-Message-ID</H1>

Normally the Message-ID header that Pine generates when sending a message
contains the name of the computer from which the message is being sent.
Some believe that this hostname could be used by spammers or could
be used by others for nefarious purposes.
If this feature is set, that name will be transformed with a simple
Rot13 transformation.
The result will still have the correct syntax for a Message-ID but the
part of the MessageID that is often a domain name will not be an actual
domain name because the letters will be scrambled.
<P>
It is possible (but unlikely?) that some spam detection
software will use that as a reason to reject the mail as spam.
It has also been reported that some spam detection software uses the
fact that there are no dots after the &quot;@&quot; as a reason to reject
messages.
If your PC-Pine Message-ID is using a name without a dot that is because
that is what Windows thinks is your &quot;Full computer name&quot;.
The method used to set this varies from one type of Windows to another but
check under Settings -> Control Panel -> System and
look for Network Identification or Computer Name or something similar.
How to set it is beyond the scope of Pine.

<H1>FEATURE: Downgrade-Multipart-To-Text</H1>

<P>
This feature affects Pine's behavior when sending mail.  Internet
standards require Pine to translate all non-ASCII characters in
messages that it sends using MIME encoding.  This encoding can be
ostensibly broken for recipients if any agent between Pine and the
recipient, such as an email list expander, appends text to the
message, such as list information or advertising.  When sending such
messages Pine attempts to protect such encoding by placing extra
MIME boundaries around the message text.
<P>
These extra boundaries are invisible to recipients that 
use MIME-aware email programs (the vast majority).  However, if
you correspond with users of email programs that are not MIME-aware,
or do not handle the extra boundaries gracefully, you can
use this feature to prevent Pine from including the extra
MIME information.  Of course, it will increase the likelihood
that non-ASCII text you send may appear corrupt to the recipient.

<H1>FEATURE: Enable-Delivery-Status-Notification</H1>

This feature affects the behavior of Pine's mail sending.  If set, this
feature enables a subcommand in the composer's &quot;Send?&quot; confirmation
prompt.  The subcommand allows you to tell Pine to request the type of
Delivery Status Notification (DSN) which you would like.  Most users will
be happy with the default, and need not enable this feature.
<P>
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_send_wo_confirm">&quot;Send-Without-Confirm&quot;</A> is set,
then this feature has no effect and the type of DSN is not selectable.

<P>
Turning on this feature and then turning on the DSNOpts from the send
prompt reveals four on-off toggles at the bottom of the screen.
The &quot;X&quot; command toggles between NoErrRets and ErrRets.  NoErrRets requests
that no notification be returned to you, even if there is a delivery
failure.  The &quot;D&quot; key toggles between Delay and NoDelay.  This tells the
server that you are willing (or not) to receive delay notifications, which
happen when there is an unusual delay at some mail server (in that mail
server's opinion).  The &quot;S&quot; key toggles between Success and NoSuccess.
Success requests that you be sent a DSN message when the message is
successfully delivered to the recipients mailbox.  Setting NoErrRets will
automatically turn off Delay and Success notification, and will flip the
toggles to show that.  Similarly, turning on Delay and/or Success will
automatically toggle the &quot;X&quot; key to ErrRets.  The fourth command, the
&quot;H&quot; key, toggles between RetHdrs and RetFull.  RetFull requests that
the full message be returned in any failed DSN.  RetHdrs requests that
only the headers be returned in any failed DSN.  Notice that this command
applies only to failed delivery status reports.  For delay or success
reports, the full message is never returned, only the headers are returned.

<P>
If you don't enable the DSN feature or if you don't turn it on for a
particular message, the default is that you will be notified about failures,
you might be notified about delays, and you won't be notified about
successes.  You will usually receive the full message back when there is
a failure.

<P>
If you turn on the DSNOpts the default is to return as much information as
possible to you.  That is, by default, the Success and Delay options are
turned on and the full message will be returned on failure.

<P>
The sending prompt will display the current DSN request (if any) in a
shorthand form.  It will be:

<P><CENTER>[Never]</CENTER>

<P>
if you have requested NoErrRets.  Otherwise, it will look something like:

<P><CENTER>[FDS-Hdrs]</CENTER>

<P>
The &quot;F&quot; will always be there, indicating that you will be notified
of failures.  (Pine doesn't provide a way to request no failure notification
and at the same time request either success or delay notification.  The only
way to request no failure notifications is to request no notifications at
all with NoErrRets.)  The &quot;D&quot; and/or &quot;S&quot; will be present if you have
requested Delay and/or Success notification.  If one of those is missing,
that means you are requesting no notification of the corresponding type.
After the dash it will say either Hdrs or Full.  Hdrs means to return only
the headers and Full means to return the full message (applies to
failure notifications only).

<P>
NOTE: This feature relies on your system's mail transport agent or
configured
<A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;SMTP-Server&quot;</A>
having the negotiation mechanism introduced in
&quot;Extended SMTP&quot; (ESMTP) and the specific extension called
&quot;Delivery Status Notification&quot; (DSN).  If the mail tranport agent you
are using doesn't support DSN, a short warning will be shown to you on
the message line at the bottom of the screen after you send your message,
but your message will have been sent anyway.

<P>
Note that DSNs don't provide a mechanism to request read receipts.  That
is, if you request notification on success you are notified when the
message is delivered to the mailbox, not when the message is read.

<P>
ESMTP allows for graceful migration to upgraded mail transfer agents, but
it is possible that this feature might cause problems for some servers.

<H1>FEATURE: Enable-Arrow-Navigation-Relaxed</H1>

This feature controls the behavior of the left, right, up and down
arrow keys in the FOLDER LIST screen when the &quot;<A
HREF="h_config_arrow_nav">Enable-Arrow-Navigation</A>&quot; feature is
enabled.

<P>
Normally, when the &quot;Enable-Arrow-Navigation&quot; feature is set,
the left and right arrow keys in the Folder List screen strictly
track the commands bound to the '&lt;' and '&gt;' keys, and the up
and down arrow keys move the highlight bar to the previous and next
folder or directory name.

<P>

When enabled, this feature returns the left, right, up and down
arrow keys' functionality in the FOLDER LIST screen to what it was
before enabling
&quot;Enable-Arrow-Navigation&quot;.  In other words, left and right
arrows move the highlight bar to the left or right, and the up and
down arrows move it up or down.

<H1>FEATURE: Alternate-Compose-Menu</H1>

This feature controls the menu that is displayed when Compose is selected.
If set, a list of options will be presented, with each option representing
the type of composition that could be used. This feature is most useful for
users who want to avoid being prompted with each option separately, or who
want to avoid the checking of remote postponed or form letter folders.
The possible types of composition are:

<P>
New, for starting a new composition. Note that if New is selected and roles
are set, roles are checked for matches and applied according to the setting
of the matching role.

<P>
Interrupted, for continuing an interrupted composition. This option is only
offered if an interrupted message folder is detected.

<P>
Postponed, for continuing postponed compositions. This option is offered
if a Postponed-Folder is set in the config REGARDLESS OF whether or not
the postponed folder actually exists. This option is especially handy
for avoiding having to check for the existence of a remote postponed folder.

<P>
Form, for using form letters. This option is offered if the Form-Letter-Folder
is set in the config, and is not checked for existence for reasons similar
to those explained by the postponed option.

<P>
setRole, for selecting a role to apply to a composition.

Normally the <A HREF="h_common_role">Role Command</A> allows you to choose
a role and compose a new message using that role.
When this feature is set, the role command will first ask whether you want to
Compose a new message, Forward the current message, Reply to the
current message, or Bounce the current message.
If you are not in the MESSAGE INDEX and are not viewing a message,
then there is no current message and the question will be skipped.
After you have chosen to Compose, Forward, Reply, or Bounce you will
then choose the role to be used.
<P>
When Bouncing the &quot;Set From&quot; address is used for the
Resent-From header, the &quot;Set Fcc&quot; value is used for the Fcc
provided that the option
<A HREF="h_config_fcc_on_bounce">&quot;Fcc-On-Bounce&quot;</A> is turned on,
and the &quot;Use SMTP Server&quot; value is used for the SMTP server, if
set.

<TITLE>FEATURE: Quell-Flowed-Text</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: Quell-Flowed-Text</H1>
<P>
Beginning with version 4.60, Pine generates flowed text where possible.
The method for generating flowed text is defined by
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt">RFC 3676</A>,
the benefit of doing so is
to send message text that can properly be viewed both on normal width displays
and on displays with smaller or larger than normal screen widths.
With flowed text, a space at the end of a line tells the receiving mail
client that the following line belongs to the same paragraph.
Quoted text will also be affected, with only the innermost
level of &quot;&gt;&quot; quoting being followed by a space.
However, if you have changed the
<A HREF="h_config_reply_indent_string">&quot;Reply-Indent-String&quot;</A>
so that it is not equal to the default value of &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&quot;, then
quoted text will not be flowed.
For this reason, we recommend that you leave your
&quot;Reply-Indent-String&quot; set to the default.
<P>
This feature turns off the generation of flowed text, as it might be
desired to more tightly control how a message is displayed on the receiving end.
<P>
If this feature is <EM>not</EM> set, you can control on a message by message
basis whether or not flowed text is generated.
You do this by typing ^V at the Send confirmation prompt that you get
after typing ^X to send a message.
^V is a toggle which turns flowing off and back on if typed again.
If for some reason flowing cannot be done on a particular message, then the
^V command will not be available.
This would be the case, for example, if this feature was set, or if your
&quot;Reply-Indent-String&quot; was set to a non-default value.
If the feature
<A HREF="h_config_send_wo_confirm">&quot;Send-Without-Confirm&quot;</A> is set,
then the opportunity to control on a message by message basis
whether or not flowed text is generated is lost.
<P>
When this feature is not set and you have typed ^V to turn off flowing,
the Send confirmation prompt will change to look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Send message (not flowed)?</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<A HREF="h_config_strip_ws_before_send">&quot;Strip-Whitespace-Before-Send&quot;</A> will
also turn off the sending of flowed text messages, but it differs in that
it also trims all trailing white space from a message before sending it.
<P>
If alternate editors are used extensively, be aware that a message will still
be sent flowed if this feature is unset.  In most cases this will be fine,
but if the editor has a &quot;flowed text&quot; mode, it would be best to
use that.

<H1>FEATURE: Strip-Whitespace-Before-Send</H1>
<P>
Starting with Pine 4.60, trailing whitespace is no longer stripped from
a message before sending.  Trailing whitespace should have no effect on an
email message, and in flowed text can aid in delimiting paragraphs.
However, the old behavior of stripping trailing whitespace was in place
to better deal with older clients that couldn't handle certain types of
text encodings.  This feature restores the old behavior
<P>
Trailing whitespace is of aid to flowed-text-formatted messages, which are
generated by default but can be turned off via the
<A HREF="h_config_quell_flowed_text">&quot;Quell-Flowed-Text&quot;</A> feature.
Strip-Whitespace-Before-Send also has the effect of turning off sending
of flowed text.

text, press ^R, which turns the prompt into

Search (to replace):

and then press Enter.  The cursor will highlight the first occurrence 
of the text string you entered, and the prompt will show: 

<P>

Replace "<your text string>" with : 

<P>

where <your text string> is what you entered at the previous prompt;
here, enter the replacement text.  To only replace the highlighted 
occurrence, simply press Enter now; to replace all occurrences in the 
message, press ^X (Repl All), then Enter.  You will then be asked to confirm 
each replacement.

The command ^R toggles between "Replace" and "Don't Replace"; its subcommand
^X toggles between "Replace All" and "Replace One."

A message being viewed may contain alternate versions of the same content.
Those alternate versions are ordered by the sending software such that the
first alternative is the least preferred and the last alternative is the
most preferred. Pine will normally display the most-preferred version that
it knows how to display. This is most often encountered where the two
alternate versions are a plain text version and an HTML version, with the
HTML version listed last as the most preferred.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: Pass-Control-Characters-as-is</H1>

UNIX Pine only (this feature is automatically on with PC-Pine).
<P>
This feature controls how certain characters contained in messages are
displayed.
If set, all characters in a message will be sent to the
screen. Normally, control characters are automatically suppressed in
order to avoid inadvertently changing terminal setup parameters.
Control characters are usually displayed as two character sequences like
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^C </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for Control-C,
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^[ </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for ESCAPE,
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^? </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for DELETE, and
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ~E </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for the character with value 133 (0x85).
(The DEL character is displayed as ^?, regular control characters are displayed
as the character ^ followed by the character obtained by adding the
five low-order bits of the character to 0x40, and the C1
control characters 0x80 - 0x9F are displayed as the character ~ followed by the
character obtained by adding the
five low-order bits of the character to 0x40.)
Sometimes, in cases where changing a single control character into a
two-character sequence would confuse Pine's display routines,
a question mark is substituted for the control character.
<P>
If you wish to filter out regular control characters but pass the
so-called C1 control characters (0x80 <= char < 0xA0) through unchanged, then
you may leave this feature unset and set the feature <A HREF="h_config_pass_c1_control">Pass-C1-Control-Characters-as-is</A> instead.
This feature is not available in PC-Pine where control characters
are never suppressed.

intended to cause the SMTP server to provide a more detailed account of

Note, this feature relies on a specific capability of the system's mail
transport agent or configured

It is possible that this
feature will cause problems for some tranport agents, and may result in
sending failure.  In addition, as the verbose output comes from the mail
transport agent, it is likely to vary from one system to another.

subscribed.

<P>
NOTE: As currently implemented, enabling this feature may increase the
time it takes the Expunge command and newsgroup closing to complete.

This feature controls what Pine does as it closes a newsgroup.
When set, Pine will offer to delete all messages from the newsgroup
as you are quitting Pine or opening a new folder.

<P>
This feature is useful if you typically read all the interesting messages
in a newsgroup each time you open it.  This feature saves you from
having to delete each message in a newsgroup as you read it or from
selecting all the messages and doing an

move on to the next folder or newsgroup.

the case where you are using one of the
&quot;separate-index-screen&quot; styles for the configuration option
<A HREF="h_config_thread_index_style">&quot;Threading-Index-Style&quot;</A>
and currently have the folder sorted by a Threaded or OrderedSubject sort.
When you are Viewing a particular thread you have a
MESSAGE INDEX of only the messages in that thread.
If you press the Next command with the last message in the thread highlighted
you will normally be asked if you want to &quot;View next thread?&quot;,
assuming there is a next thread to view.
If this feature is set it will be assumed that you always want to view the
next thread and you won't be asked to confirm that.
Similarly, if the first message of the thread is highlighted and you
press the Prev command, this feature will prevent the question
&quot;View previous thread&quot;.
<P>
This feature only has an effect in the MESSAGE INDEX screen.
If you then view a particular message from that screen and press the
Next command, you will be sent to the next thread without being asked,
independent of the setting of this feature.

<H1>OPTION: Keyword-Surrounding-Chars</H1>

This option controls a minor aspect of Pine's MESSAGE INDEX and MESSAGE
TEXT screens.
If you have modified the
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A>&quot; option
so that either the &quot;SUBJKEY&quot; or &quot;SUBJKEYINIT&quot; tokens
are used to display keywords or their initials along with the Subject; then
this option may be used to modify the resulting display slightly.
By default, the keywords or initials displayed for these tokens will be
surrounded with curly braces ({ and }) and a trailing space.
For example, if keywords &quot;Work&quot; and &quot;Now&quot; are set for
a message, the &quot;SUBJKEY&quot; token will normally look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{Work Now} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and the SUBJKEYINIT token would look like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{WN} actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The default character before the keywords is the left brace ({) and the
default after the keywords is the right brace followed by a space (} ).
<P>
This option allows you to change that.
You should set it to two values separated by a space.
The values may be quoted if they include space characters.
So, for example, the default value could be specified explicitly by setting this
option to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Keyword-Surrounding-chars="{" "} "</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The first part wouldn't need to be quoted (but it doesn't hurt).
The second part does need the quotes because it includes a space character.
If you wanted to change the braces to brackets you could use
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Keyword-Surrounding-chars="[" "] "</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Inside the quotes you can use backslash quote to mean quote, so
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Keyword-Surrounding-chars="&#92;"" "&#92;" "</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>"Work Now" actual subject</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is also possible to color keywords in the index using the
Setup/Kolor screen (<A HREF="h_config_kw_color">Keyword Colors</A>).
<P>
It is not possible to change the fact that a space character is used to
separate the keywords if more than one keyword is set for a message.
It is also not possible to change the fact that there are no separators
between the keyword initials if more than one keyword is set.

This feature affects which message is selected as the current message
when you enter a

<P>
Normally, the starting position for an incoming folder (which most Stay Open
folders will likely be) is controlled by the

However, if a folder is a Stay Open folder, when you re-enter the folder
after the first time the current message will be the same as it was when
you left the folder.
An exception is made if you use the TAB command to get to the folder.
In that case, the message number will be incremented by one from what it
was when you left the folder.
<P>
The above special behavior is thought to be useful.
However, it is special and different from what you might at first expect.
If this feature is set, then Stay Open folders will not be treated specially
as far as the startup rule is concerned.

It also asks whether or not you would like to delete some old folders.
See the <A HREF="h_config_pruning_rule">Pruning-Rule</A> option for an

<P>
By default, the name used when renaming a folder looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&lt;foldername&gt;-&lt;month&gt;-&lt;year&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
For example, the first time you run Pine in May of 2004,
the folder &quot;sent-mail&quot; might be renamed to
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>sent-mail-apr-2004</SAMP></CENTER>

<H1>OPTION: Color-Style</H1>

UNIX Pine only.
<P>
If the terminal or terminal emulator you are using is capable of displaying
colors, this option controls whether or not color will be used in Pine.
If you turn color on and things are set up correctly,
you should see color appear on the screen immmediately.
Modern terminal emulators are usually capable of displaying colors.
<P>
The available options include:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>no-color</DT>
<DD>Don't use color.
</DD>

<DT>use-termdef</DT>
<DD>In order to decide if your terminal is capable of color, Pine looks in
the terminal capabilities database, TERMINFO or TERMCAP, depending on
how Pine was compiled.
This is a good option to choose if you switch between a color and a non-color
terminal with the same Pine configuration.
Pine will know to use color on the color terminal because it is described
in the termcap entry, and Pine will know to use black and white on the
non-color terminal.
The Pine Technical Notes
<CENTER><SAMP><A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/">http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/</A></SAMP></CENTER>
have more information on configuring a TERMCAP or TERMINFO
entry for color Pine.
This is usually something a system administrator does.
</DD>

<DT>force-ansi-8color</DT>
<DD>This is probably the setting that most people should use.
Because setting up a termcap entry is confusing and because the
terminal capabilities database is often not correctly configured for color,
this choice and the next may be easier for you to use.
If your terminal emulator responds to ANSI color escape sequences, which
many do, this option will cause Pine to believe your terminal will respond
to the escape sequences which produce eight different foreground and background
colors.
The escape sequences used to set the foreground colors are

  <P><CENTER>ESC&nbsp;[&nbsp;3&nbsp;&lt;color_number&gt;&nbsp;m</CENTER><P>

where the color_number is an ASCII digit between 0 and 7.
The numbers 0 through 7 should correspond to the colors black, red, green,
yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
Some terminal emulators use a pre-ANSI scheme which swaps
the colors blue and red and the colors yellow and cyan.
This will cause the default colors to be different, but other than that
things should work fine.
The escape sequences used to set the background colors are the same
as for the foreground colors except a &quot;4&quot; replaces the &quot;3&quot;.
<P>
Note: With the Tera Term terminal emulator this setting works well.
You should also have the Tera Term &quot;Full color&quot; option turned OFF.
You may find the &quot;Full color&quot; option in Tera Term's &quot;Setup&quot;
menu, in the &quot;Window&quot; submenu.
</DD>

<DT>force-ansi-16color</DT>
<DD>Many terminal emulators know about the same eight colors above
plus eight more.
This option attempts to use all 16 colors.
The same escape sequences as for the eight-color terminal are used
for the first eight colors.
The escape sequences used to set foreground colors 8-15 are the same as
for 0-7 except the &quot;3&quot; is replaced with a &quot;9&quot;.
The background color sequences for colors 8-15 are the same as for 0-7
except the &quot;4&quot; is replaced with &quot;10&quot;.
You can tell if the 16 colors are working by turning on this option
and then going into one of the color configuration screens, for example,
the configuration screen for Normal Color.
If you see 16 different colors to select from, it's working.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The normal default is &quot;no-color&quot;.
<P>

Once you've turned on color you may set the
colors of many objects on the screen individually.
For example, you may add colors to the status letters on the MESSAGE
INDEX page.
Most categories of color which Pine supports are configurable here.
For example, &quot;Normal Color&quot;
is the color used to display most of the text in Pine, and
&quot;Reverse Color&quot; is used to display highlighted text, such as the
current message in the MESSAGE INDEX.
<P>
Lines in the MESSAGE INDEX may also be colored.
Use Setup Rules to get to the Indexcolor configuration screen.

<H1>FEATURE: Try-Alternative-Authentication-Driver-First</H1>

This feature affects how Pine connects to IMAP servers.
It's utility has largely been overtaken by events,
but it may still be useful in some circumstances.
If you only connect to modern IMAP servers that support
&quot;TLS&quot; you can ignore this feature.

<P>
Details:

<P>
By default, Pine will attempt to connect to an IMAP server on the
normal IMAP service port (143), and if the server offers &quot;Transport Layer
Security&quot; (TLS) and Pine has been compiled with encryption capability,
then a secure (encrypted) session will be negotiated.

<P>
With this feature enabled, before connecting on the normal IMAP port, Pine
will first attempt to connect to an alternate IMAP service port (993) used
specifically for encrypted IMAP sessions via the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) method.
If the SSL attempt fails, Pine will then try the default
behavior described in the previous paragraph.

<P>
TLS negotiation on the normal port is preferred, and supersedes the use of
SSL on port 993, but older servers may not provide TLS support.
This feature may be convenient when accessing IMAP servers that do not support
TLS, but do support SSL connections on port 993.
However, it is important to understand that with this feature enabled,
Pine will <EM>attempt</EM> to make a secure connection if that is possible,
but it will proceed to make an insecure connection if that is the only
option offered by the server, or if the Pine in question has been built
without encryption capability.

<P>
Note that this feature specifies a per-user (or system-wide) default
behavior, but host/folder specification flags may be used to control the
behavior of any specific connection.
This feature interacts with some of
the possible host/folder path specification flags as follows:

<P>
The <SAMP>/tls</SAMP> host flag, for example,

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{foo.example.com/tls}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will over-ride this feature for the specified host by bypassing the
SSL connection attempt.
Moreover, with <SAMP>/tls</SAMP> specified,
the connection attempt will fail if the
service on port 143 does not offer TLS support.

<P>
The <SAMP>/ssl</SAMP> host flag, for example,

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{foo.example.com/ssl}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will insist on an SSL connection for the specified host,
and will fail if the SSL service on port 993 is not available.
Pine will not subsequently retry a connection
on port 143 if <SAMP>/ssl</SAMP> is specified.

<P>
Normally, when a filename is supplied that lacks a leading &quot;path&quot;
component, Pine assumes the file exists in the user's home directory.
Under Windows operating systems, this definition isn't always clear.  This 
feature allows you to explictly set where Pine should look for files
without a leading path.

<P>
NOTE: this feature's value is ignored if either 
<A HREF="h_config_use_current_dir">Use-Current-Dir</A> feature
is set or the PINERC has a value for the &quot;Operating-Dir&quot; variable.

<H1>FEATURE: Save-Will-Quote-Leading-Froms</H1>

This feature controls an aspect of the Save command (and also the way
outgoing messages are saved to an FCC folder).  If set, Pine will add
a leading &quot;>&quot; character in front of message lines beginning with &quot;From&quot; 
when they are saved to another folder, including lines syntactically
distinguishable from the type of message separator line commonly used on
Unix systems.

<P>
The default behavior is that a &quot;>&quot; will be prepended only to lines
beginning with &quot;From &quot; that might otherwise be confused with a message
separator line on Unix systems.  If pine is the only mail program you use,
this default is reasonable.  If another program you use has trouble
displaying a message with an unquoted &quot;From &quot; saved by Pine, you should
enable this feature.  This feature only applies to the common Unix mailbox
format that uses message separator lines beginning with &quot;From &quot;.  If
Pine has been configured to use a different mailbox format (possibly
incompatible with other mail programs), then this issue does not arise,
and the feature is irrelevant.

You may add color to the single character symbols which give the status
of each message in the MESSAGE INDEX.
By default the characters &quot;+&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;D&quot;,
&quot;A&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; show up near the left hand side of the
screen depending on whether the message is addressed to you, and whether
the message is marked Important, is Deleted, is Answered, or is New.
The color for each of those characters may be specified by setting the
&quot;Index-to-me&quot; Symbol Color,
the &quot;Index-important&quot; Symbol Color,
the &quot;Index-deleted&quot; Symbol Color,
the &quot;Index-answered&quot; Symbol Color,
and the &quot;Index-new&quot; Symbol Color.
There are also two other symbol colors called &quot;Index-recent&quot;
and &quot;Index-unseen&quot;.
These two colors will only be used if you have configured your
&quot;<A HREF="h_config_index_format">Index-Format</A>&quot; option
to include the &quot;IMAPSTATUS&quot; token.
<P>
Besides coloring the message status symbols, you may also color the
entire index line.
This is done by using the

menu at the bottom of the screen.
For example, some of the screens have a &quot;P PrevMsg&quot; command.
This option sets the color used when displaying &quot;PrevMsg&quot;.
The foreground color is the color of the actual character and the
background color is the color of the area behind the character.
By default, the KeyLabel Color is the same as the Normal Color.
<P>
WARNING: Some terminal emulators have the property that the screen will scroll
down one line whenever a character is written to the character cell in the
lower right corner of the screen.
Pine can usually avoid writing a character in that corner of the screen.
However, if you have defined a KeyLabel Color then Pine does have to write
a character in that cell in order to color the cell correctly.
If you find that your display sometimes scrolls up a line this could be
the problem.
The most obvious symptom is probably that the titlebar at the top of the
screen scrolls off the screen.
Try setting KeyLabel Color to Default to see if that fixes the problem.

If a line begins with a &gt; character (or space followed by &gt;)
it is considered a quote.
That line will be given the Quote1 Color (first level quote).
If there is a second level of quoting then the Quote2 Color will be used.
Pine considers there to be a second level of quoting if that first &gt; is
followed by another &gt; (or space followed by &gt;).
If there are characters other than whitespace and &gt; signs, then it isn't
considered another level of quoting.
Similarly, if there is a third level of quoting the Quote3 Color will be
used.
If there are more levels after that the Quote Colors are re-used.
If you define all three colors then it would repeat like Color1, Color2, Color3,
Color1, Color2, Color3, ...
If you only define the first two it would be
Color1, Color2, Color1, Color2, ...
If you define only the Quote1 Color, then the entire quote would be that

For example, if you are working on a color for the Subject header and
you fill in a pattern of &quot;important&quot;, then only Subjects which
contain the word &quot;important&quot; will be colored.
<P>
For address headers (like From and To) and for the Newsgroups header,
a pattern match will cause only the matched addresses or newsgroups to be
colored.
If there is no pattern to match, then all of the addresses or newsgroups
in the relevant header will be colored.
<P>
The matching pattern may be a comma-separated list of patterns to match
instead of a single pattern.
For example, you could use the pattern &quot;important,urgent&quot; which would
cause a match if either the word &quot;important&quot; or the word
&quot;urgent&quot; appeared in the value of the header.
You could list several comma-separated email addresses in the Header
From Color pattern so that those addresses will be colored when any of
them appear in the From header.

<H2>Description of the Setup Color Screen</H2>

From this screen you may turn on color and set the colors of
various parts of the Pine display.
For help on turning on color move your cursor into the Color Style section
at the top of the Setup Color screen and ask for help.

<P>
Each section of the rest of the color setup screen has a title
which describes briefly what effect the setting will have.
For example, the Status Color section sets the color for status messages.
Read the help in each section for a description of the effect of setting
the color for that section.
Highlight the section you want to change by moving the cursor into it, then
select the foreground and background colors desired by using the Next and
Prev keys to highlight the color, and the * command to select it.
<P>
To set a color to its default value, set the X in the Default line at
the bottom of the list of colors.
Most colors default to being the same as either the Normal Color or the
Reverse Color.
See the help for the particular color section to see which.
<P>

Besides coloring the specific fields that Pine knows about, you may also
color specific header fields when viewing a message in the MESSAGE TEXT
screen.
For example, you may color the Subject header a particular color.
There are a few commands for use with headers.
The &quot;AddHeader&quot; command adds a section to the color
configuration screen which allows you to set the color for that header.
You'll be asked for the name of the header field you want to color.
If you wanted to color the Subject, you would answer
with the word &quot;subject&quot;.
Once you've added a header field, the color setting works just like the
other color fields, except that there is an additional line on the
config screen labeled &quot;Pattern to match&quot;.
If you leave that blank, then the whole field for that header will always
be colored.
However, if you give a pattern to match, the coloring will only take place
if there is a match for that pattern in the value of the field.
For example, if you are working on a color for the Subject header and
you fill in a pattern of &quot;important&quot;, then only Subjects which
contain the word &quot;important&quot; will be colored.
<P>
The &quot;DeleteHdr&quot; command removes a header section from the
configuration altogether.
The &quot;Shuffle&quot; command changes the order of header sections.
This is only necessary if you use header sections with pattern fields.
For example, if you have two Subject sections, one with one pattern and
another with another pattern, and the subject for a particular message
happens to match both, then the color from the first match is used.
<P>

The command &quot;RestoreDefs&quot; will restore all of the default colors.
Each section will change to the default value used for that section when
color is first enabled.
When you restore all default colors the color settings for the Header Colors
will be unset (since that's the default), but the header fields you've
added will remain so that you may easily reset them.
In order to get rid of them completely you'd have to use
the &quot;DeleteHdr&quot; command.

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: News-Approximates-New-Status</H1>

This feature causes certain messages to be marked as "New" in the
MESSAGE INDEX of newsgroups.

<P>

When opening a newsgroup, Pine will consult your "newsrc" file and
determine the last message you have previously disposed of via the "D"
key.  If this feature is set, any subsequent messages will be shown in the
Index with an "N", and the first of these messages will be highlighted.
Although this is only an approximation of true "New" or "unseen"
status, it provides a useful cue to distinguish more-or-less recent
messages from those you have seen previously, but are not yet ready to
mark deleted.

<P>

Background: your "newsrc" file (used to store message status information
for newsgroups) is only capable of storing a single flag, and Pine uses
this to record whether or not you are "done with" a message, as
indicated by marking the message as "Deleted".  Unfortunately, this
means that Pine has no way to record exactly which messages you have
previously seen, so it normally does not show the "N" status flag for
any messages in a newsgroup. This feature enables a starting
*approximation* of seen/unseen status that may be useful.

<H1>FEATURE: Expose-Hidden-Config</H1>

If set, this causes configuration options and features which are normally

<P>
The purpose of this feature is to allow you to change configuration
features and variables which are normally hidden.
This is particularly useful if you are using a remote configuration,
where it is difficult to edit the contents manually, but it may also be used
on a local pinerc configuration file.

Note that this is an advanced feature which should be used with care.
The reason that this part of the configuration is normally hidden is because
there is a significant potential for causing problems if you change these
variables.
If something breaks after a change try changing it back to see if that is
what is causing the problem.
There are also some variables which are normally hidden because they are
manipulated through Pine in other ways.
For example, colors are normally set using the Setup/Kolors screen and
the &quot;Address-Book&quot; variable is normally set using
the Setup/AddressBooks screen, so there is little reason to edit these directly.
The &quot;Incoming-Folders&quot; variable is normally changed by using
the Add, Delete, and Rename commands in the FOLDER LIST screen,
and the &quot;Last-Time-Prune-Questioned&quot; variable is normally used
internally by Pine and not set directly by the user.

<H1>FEATURE: Disable-Password-Caching</H1>

Normally, loginname/password combinations are cached in Pine so that
you do not have to enter the same password more than once in a session.
A disadvantage to this approach is that the password must be stored in
the memory image of the running Pine in order that it can be re-used.
In the event that Pine crashes and produces a core dump, and that core
dump is readable by others, the loginname and password could be read
from the core dump.
<P>
If this feature is set, then the passwords will not be cached and you
will have to retype the password whenever Pine needs it.
Even with this feature set there is still some chance that the core
file will contain a password, so care should be taken to make the
core files unreadable.
<P>
NOTE: If PASSFILE caching is enabled, this does not disable it.
That is a separate and independent feature.

<H1>FEATURE: Quell-Content-ID</H1>

This feature changes the behavior of Pine when sending messages.
It is intended to work around a bug in Microsoft's Outlook XP mail user
agent.
As of this writing, Microsoft has acknowledged the bug but
has not added it to the Knowledge Base.
We have been told that there will be a post-SP1 hotfix for Outlook XP.
This particular bug has bug fix number OfficeQFE:4781.
The nature of the bug is that messages with attachments which
contain a Content-ID header (which standard Pine attachments do)
do not show the attachment indicator (a paperclip) when viewed with
Outlook XP.
So the user has no indication that the message contains an attachment.

<P>
If this feature is set then Pine will remove most Content-ID headers
before sending a message.
If an attachment is of type MESSAGE, then the existing Content-ID headers
inside the message will be left intact.
This would only happen with Pine if a message was forwarded as an attachment
or if a message with a message attached was forwarded.
Similarly if an attachment of type MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE is forwarded,
the Content-ID headers of the alternative parts will not be removed.

<P>
Because the Content-ID header is a standard part of MIME it is possible
that setting this feature will break something.
For example, if an attachment has a Content-ID header which is necessary
for the correct functioning of that attachment, it is possible that Pine
may remove that header when the attachment is forwarded.
However, it seems fairly safe at this time.

Partial fetching is a feature of the IMAP protocol.
By default, Pine
will use partial fetching when copying the contents of a message or attachment
from the IMAP server to Pine.
This means that the fetch will be done in many
small chunks instead of one big chunk. The main benefit of this approach is
that the fetch becomes interruptible. That is, the user can type <EM>^C</EM>
to stop the fetch early. In some cases partial fetching may cause a performance
problem so that the fetching of data takes significantly longer when partial
fetching is used. Turning on this feature will turn off partial fetching.

parent process is not intended to be used interactively.  Examples include
invoking Pine via the -e argument of the Unix &quot;xterm&quot; program,

require that all electronic mail messages traversing the global Internet
consist of 7bit ASCII characters unless a pair of cooperating mail 
transfer agents explicitly agree to allow 8bit messages.  In general, 
then, exchanging messages in non-ASCII characters requires MIME encoding.
<P>
However, there are now Internet standards that allow for unencoded 8bit
exchange of messages between cooperating systems.  Setting this feature
tells Pine to try to negotiate unencoded 8bit transmission during the
sending process.  Should the negotiation fail, Pine will fall back to its
ordinary encoding rules. 
<P>
Note, this feature relies on your system's mail transport agent or
configured <A HREF="h_config_smtp_server">&quot;SMTP-Server&quot;</A>
having the negotiation mechanism introduced in
&quot;Extended SMTP&quot; (ESMTP) and the specific extension called
&quot;8BITMIME&quot;. 
<P>
ESMTP allows for graceful migration to upgraded mail transfer agents, but
it is possible that this feature might cause problems for some servers.

<H1>FEATURE: Enable-8bit-NNTP-Posting</H1>

This feature affects Pine's behavior when posting news.  

<P>

The Internet standard for exchanging USENET news messages (RFC-1036)
specifies that USENET messages should conform to Internet mail standards
and contain only 7bit characters, but much of the news transport software
in use today is capable of successfully sending messages containing 8bit
characters.  Hence, many people believe that it is appropriate to send 8bit
news messages without any MIME encoding.

<P>

Moreover, there is no Internet standard for explicitly negotiating 8bit
transfer, as there is for Internet email.  Therefore, Pine provides the
option of posting unencoded 8bit news messages, though not as the default.
Setting this feature will turn OFF Pine's MIME encoding of newsgroup
postings that contain 8bit characters. 

<P>

Note, articles may cross a path or pass through news transport software
that is unsafe or even hostile to 8bit characters.  At best this will only
cause the posting to become garbled.  The safest way to transmit 8bit
characters is to leave Pine's MIME encoding turned on, but recipients
who lack MIME-aware tools are often annoyed when they receive MIME-encoded 
messages.

<H1>FEATURE: Tab-Uses-Unseen-For-Next-Folder</H1>

This feature affects Pine's behavior when using the TAB
<A HREF="h_common_nextnew">NextNew Command</A>
to move from one folder to the next.
Pine's usual behavior is to search for folders
with <EM>Recent</EM> messages in them.
Recent messages are messages which have arrived since the last time the
folder was opened.

<P>
Setting this feature causes Pine to search for <EM>Unseen</EM>
messages instead of Recent messages.
Unseen messages remain Unseen until you view them (or flag then as Seen with
the <A HREF="h_common_flag">Flag Command</A>).
Setting this feature allows you to locate messages you have not read
instead of only recently received messages.
When this feature is set, the feature
<A HREF="h_config_fast_recent">&quot;Enable-Fast-Recent-Test&quot;</A>
will have no effect, so the checking may be slower.

<P>
Another reason why you might want to use this feature is that Pine sometimes
opens folders implicitly behind the scenes, and this clears the
Recent status of all messages in the folder.
One example where this happens is when Saving or filtering a
message to another folder.
If that message has some <A HREF="h_config_keywords">keywords</A>
set, then because of some shortcomings
in the IMAP specification, the best way to ensure that those keywords are
still set in the saved copy of the message is to open the folder and
set the keywords explicitly.
Because this clears the Recent status of all messages in that folder the
folder will not be found by the NextNew command unless this feature is set.

This feature affects Pine's behavior when it encounters a problem
acquiring a mail folder lock.  Typically, a secondary file associated

process.  On some systems, such file creation has been administratively
precluded by the system configuration.

Pine issues a warning when such failures occur, which can become bothersome

introduce some risk of mail folder corruption when more than one program
attempts to modify the mail folder.  This is most likely to occur to one's

<H1>FEATURE: Quell-Folder-Internal-Msg</H1>
This feature determines whether or not Pine will create 
&quot;pseudo messages&quot; in folders that are in standard Unix or 
MMDF format. <P> 

Pine will normally create these pseudo messages when they are not already
present in a standard Unix or MMDF folder.  Their purpose is to record
certain mailbox state data needed for correct IMAP and POP server
operation, and also for Pine to be able to mark messages as Answered when
the Reply has been postponed.<P>

Sites which do not use IMAP/POP for remote mail access, and which need to
support mail tools that are adversely affected by the presence of the
pseudo-messages (e.g. some mail notification tools) may enable this
feature to tell Pine not to create them.  Note that Pine's 
&quot;Answered&quot; flag
capability will be adversely affected if this is done.<P>

Note too that, even if this feature is enabled, Pine will not remove
pseudo-messages when it encounters them (e.g. those created by UW's imapd
or ipopd servers.) This feature has no effect on folders that are not in
standard Unix or MMDF format, as pseudo-messages are not needed in the
other formats to record mailbox state information.

<TITLE>FEATURE: termdef-takes-precedence</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>FEATURE: termdef-takes-precedence</H1>

This feature may affect Pine's low-level input routines.  Termcap (or
terminfo, depending on how your copy of Pine was compiled and linked)
is the name of the database which describes terminal capabilities.  In
particular, it describes the sequences of characters that various keys
will emit.

<P>
An example would be the Up Arrow key on the keyboard.  Up
Arrow is not a distinct character on most Unix systems.  When you press
the Up Arrow key a short sequence of characters are produced.  This
sequence is supposed to be described in the termcap database by the
&quot;ku&quot; capability (or by the &quot;kcuu1&quot; capability if you
are using terminfo instead of termcap).

<P>
By default, Pine defines some terminal
escape sequences that are commonly used.  For example, the sequence
&quot;ESC&nbsp;O&nbsp;A&quot; is recognized as an Up Arrow key.  The sequence
&quot;ESC&nbsp;[&nbsp;A&quot;
is also recognized as an Up Arrow key.  These are chosen because common
terminals like VT100's or ANSI standard terminals produce these
sequences when you press the Up Arrow key.

<P>
If your system's termcap
(terminfo) database assigns some other function to the sequence
&quot;ESC&nbsp;O&nbsp;A&quot;
it is usually ignored by Pine.  Also, if your termcap (terminfo)
database assigns a sequence which doesn't begin with an escape
character (<SAMP>ESC</SAMP>) it is usually ignored by Pine.
This usually works fine
because most terminals emit the escape sequences that Pine has defined
by default.  We have also found that it is usually better to have these
defaults take precedence over the definitions contained in the database
because the defaults are more likely to be correct than the database.

<P>
There are some terminals where this breaks down.  If you want Pine to
believe the definitions given in your termcap (terminfo) database in
preference to the defaults the Pine itself sets up, then you may turn
this feature on.  Then, sequences of characters which are defined in
both termcap (terminfo) and in Pine's set of defaults will be
interpreted the way that termcap (terminfo) says they should be
interpreted.  Also, if your terminal capabilities database assigns a
sequence which doesn't begin with escape, it will not be ignored.

<BODY>
<H1>Rules Behavior Changes in Pine 4.50</H1>

In Pine 4.50 and later, Rules which contain unrecognized elements
are ignored.
In most cases, the unrecognized elements will be something that was
added as a new Rules feature in a later version of Pine.
In versions of Pine <EM>prior</EM> to 4.50, Pine did <EM>not</EM>
ignore rules which contained unrecognized elements.
For example, a new element of Rules which was added in Pine 4.50 is
Age interval.
Suppose you add an Indexcolor rule, using version 4.50 or later, that colors
all messages older than a week red.
Now, if you run Pine 4.44 using that same configuration file, it will not
recognize the Age interval and so will just ignore it.
That means that all messages will match that rule so all messages will
be colored red when using version 4.44.

<P>
This behavior was considered a bug so it is fixed in 4.50 and later.
However, since the behavior still exists in versions prior to 4.50 and
since Filtering is a potentially destructive operation, another measure
was taken to attempt to avoid unintentional Filtering of messages.
The first time that you run a Pine which is version 4.50 or greater,
the rules in your Filters configuration variable (&quot;Patterns-Filters&quot;)
will be copied to a new Filters configuration variable
with a different name (&quot;Patterns-Filters2&quot;).
From then on, Pine version 4.50 or higher will continue to use the new
variable.
Of course, Pine version 4.44 or lower will continue to use the old
variable.
That means that if you are using one version of Pine which is 4.50 or
newer and also using a version which is older than 4.50, they will not
share the configuration information about Filters.
If you make a change in one version you won't see it in the other version.

<P>
Since Scoring can be used to trigger Filtering, the same thing has been
done for Score rules.
The old configuration variable name is (&quot;Patterns-Scores&quot;)
and the new name is (&quot;Patterns-Scores2&quot;).
The same is not true of Role, Indexcolor, and Other rules which are
thought to be less harmful when a mistake is made.

There may be cases where a message

For example, if you deleted it in another Pine session or another mail

<H1>FILTER FEATURE: Dont-Stop-Even-if-Rule-Matches</H1>

If this option is set then this is a non-terminating rule.
Usually, for each message, Pine searches through the Filter Rules until
a match is found and then it performs the action associated with that rule.
Rules following the match are not considered.
If this option is set then the search for matches will continue at the next
rule.
<P>
If a non-terminating rule matches then the actions associated with
that rule, except for any implied deletion of the message, are performed
before the match for the next rule is checked.
For example, if the non-terminating rule sets the Important status, then that
status will be set when the next rule is considered.
However, if the non-terminating rule Moves the message, the message will
actually be copied instead of copied and deleted so that it is still there
for the next rule.
A moved message is deleted after all the relevant rules have been checked.
The name of the &quot;Move&quot; action is confusing in this case because
a single message can be moved to more than one folder.
It turns the Move into a Copy instead, but it is still followed by a deletion
at the end.
<P>
This option may be useful if you want to have a single message filtered to
two different folders because it matches two different Patterns.
For example, suppose you normally filter messages to a particular mailing
list into one folder, and messages addressed directly to you into a second
folder.
If a message is sent to both you and the list (and you can tell that by
looking at the headers of the message) this option may give you a convenient
way to capture a copy to each folder.
(It may also cause you to capture two copies to each folder,
depending on whether your mail system delivers one or two copies of the
message to you and on how the list works.)

<H1>FEATURE: Enable-Lame-List-Mode</H1>

This feature modifies the method Pine uses to ask your IMAP
server for folder names to display in the FOLDER LIST screen.
It is intended to compensate for a small set of IMAP servers that
are programmed to ignore a part of the request, and thus respond
to Pine's query with nonsensical results.
<P>

If you find that Pine is erroneously displaying blank folder lists,
try enabling this feature.
<P>

NOTE: Enabling this feature has consequences for the Goto and Save
commands.  Many servers allow access to folders outside the area
reserved for your personal folders via some reserved character,
typically '#' (sharp), '~' (tilde) or '/' (slash).  This mechanism
allows, at the Goto and Save prompts, quick access to folders
outside your personal folder collection without requiring a specific
collection definition.  This behavior will generally not be available
when this feature is enabled.

<H1>FEATURE: Enable-Multiple-Newsrcs</H1>

This feature makes it so Pine can use multiple newsrcs based on
the news server being connected to, which allows for separate lists
of subscribed-to newsgroups. When this feature is not set, there is only
one list of newsgroups.
<P>
Under this feature, the name of a newsrc is based on the news server.
For example, if your <a href="h_config_newsrc_path">Newsrc-Path</a>
is set to &quot;.newsrc&quot;, and the news server you are connecting to is
news.example.com, then the newsrc to be used is .newsrc-news.example.com.
Setting this feature for the first time will allow for the option of using
your old newsrc the next time you read news.
<P>
If this feature is set, then the feature
<A HREF="h_config_mulnews_as_typed">Mult-Newsrc-Hostnames-as-Typed</A>
also may affect the name of the newsrc file that is used.

<H1>Address Book Export Format</H1>

You are exporting address book data from Pine to a file outside of Pine.
You are being asked to choose the format of the export.
Here are the choices:

<DL>
<DT><EM>A</EM>ddress List</DT>
<DD>
The addresses from the address book entries you are saving
from will be saved one address per line.
Address book lists (those with more than one address) will have
all of their addresses saved separately.
</DD>

<DT><EM>V</EM>Card</DT>
<DD>
The entries will be saved in
<A HREF="h_whatis_vcard">vCard</A> format.
</DD>

<DT><EM>T</EM>ab Separated</DT>
<DD>
The entries will be saved in tab-separated columns.
There will be just 4 columns of data which correspond to Pine's
Nickname field, Full Name field, Address field, and Comment field.
It might prove useful to Select only the Simple, non-List address book
entries before Saving.

<H1>FEATURE: Predict-NNTP-Server</H1>

This feature allows Pine to assume that the open NNTP server at the
time of composition is the NNTP server to which the message should be
posted.  This is especially recommended when there are multiple News
collections.  If this feature is not set, Pine will try to post to the first server in
the <a href="h_config_nntp_server">NNTP-Server</a> variable.  Setting
this feature also negates the need to add News collection servers to
the NNTP-Server variable.
<P>
This feature can be especially handy when used in conjunction with
<a href="h_config_enable_mulnewsrcs">Enable-Multiple-Newsrcs</a>.

This feature modifies the method Pine uses to display Text/Plain
MIME attachments from the Attachment Index screen.  Normally, the

Enabling this feature causes Pine to ignore any external viewer
