                           Pine Source Code

This code is usually compiled by the "build" script in the directory
above.  It can be compiled by specifying the appropriate makefile for
the platform you are running on with the make -f option. The makefile
will select the correct os-xxx.h and os-xxx.c files from the osdep
subdirectory.  Pine depends on the c-client and pico libraries in
adjacent directories.  For more details and porting notes see
doc/tech-notes.
